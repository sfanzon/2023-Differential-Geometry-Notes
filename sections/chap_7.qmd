# Surfaces


::: Definition

A set $\SSS \subset \R^3$ is a **surface** if for every point $x \in \SSS$ there exist open sets $U \subset \R^2$, $V \subset \R^3$ such that

- $x \in V$,
- $U$ is diffeomorphic to $V \cap \SSS$.

Further:

- A diffeomorphism of $U$ into $V \cap \SSS$, denoted by
$$
\sss \ \colon U \to  V \cap \SSS \,
$$
is called a **surface chart**. 
- For each $i \in I$ suppose to have a surface chart
$$
\sss_i \ \colon U_i \to V_i \cap \SSS \,.
$$
We say that the family $\{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} (V_i \cap \SSS ) = \SSS \,.
$$
:::
 
Note that a surface chart $\sss$ is a map from $\R^2$ into $\R^3$.
Points in $U$ will be denoted by the pair $(u,v)$, while points in $\R^3$ by $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)$.


::: Definition

Let $U \subset \R^2$ be open. A surface chart 
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v) \ \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called **regular** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
