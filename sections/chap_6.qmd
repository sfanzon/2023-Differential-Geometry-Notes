# Topology



::: Definition

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if they hold:

- The empty set $\emptyset$ and $X$ belong to $\TT$,

- Let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$. Then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are just $\emptyset$ and $X$.
