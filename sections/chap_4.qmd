# Topology


So far we have worked in $\R^n$, where for example we have the notions of open set, continuous function and compact set. Topology is what allows us to extend these notions to arbitrary sets.



::: Definition
### Topological space   {#definition-topology}

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if the following 3 properties hold:

- (A1) We have $\emptyset, X \in \TT$,

- (A2) If $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$, then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- (A3) If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

Further, we say:

- The pair $(X,\TT)$ is a **topological space**.
- The elements of $X$ are called **points**.
- The sets in the topology $\TT$ are called **open sets**.
:::




::: {.Remark  #remark-intersection}

The intersection property of $\TT$, Property (A3) in Definition \ref{definition-topology}, is 
equivalent to the following:

- (A3') If $A_1, \ldots, A_M \in \TT$ for some $M \in \N$, then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^M A_n  \in \TT \,.
$$

> The equivalence between (A3) and (A3') can be immediately obtained by induction.

:::





::: Warning

Notice:

- The union property (A2) of $\TT$ holds for an **arbitrary** number of sets, even uncountable!
- The intersection property (A3') of $\TT$ holds only for a **finite** number of sets. 

:::



There are two main examples of topologies that one should always keep in mind. 
These are:

- **Trivial topology**: The topology with the smallest possible number of sets.
- **Discrete topology**: The topology with the highest possible number of sets.



::: Definition
### Trivial topology

Let $X$ be a set. The trivial topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{  \emptyset , X \} \,.
$$

> Let us check that $\TT$ is indeed a topology. We need to verify the 3 properties of a topology:
>
>  - (A1) We clearly have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$.
>  - (A2) The only non-trivial union to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cup X = X \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>  - (A3) The only non-trivial intersection to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cap X = \emptyset \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::




::: Definition
### Discrete topology

Let $X$ be a set. The discrete topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subset X \} \,,
$$
that is, every subset of $X$ is open.

> Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology: 
>
>  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$, since $\emptyset$ and $X$ are subsets of $X$.
>  - (A2) The arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$.
>
>  - (A3) The intersection of two subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  A \cap B \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A, B  \in \TT$.
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.

We anticipated that topology is the extension of familiar concepts of open set, continuity, etc.
that we have in $\R^n$. Let us see how the usual definition of open set of $\R^n$ can fit
in our new abstract framework of topology. 



::: Definition
### Open set of $\R^n$

Let $A \subset \R^n$. We say that the set $A$ is **open** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, x \in A \,, \,\, \exists \, r > 0 \st B_r(x) \subset A \,,
$${#eq-open-set-Rn}
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $x$
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in \R^n \divider \norm{ y - x } \leq R  \} \,, 
$$
and the **Euclidean norm** of $x \in \R^n$ is defined by 
$$
\norm{x} := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^2 } \,.
$$

See @fig-open-set-Rn for a schematic picture of an open set.

::: Definition
### Euclidean topology of $\R^n$

The Euclidean topology on $\R^n$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subset \R^n \,, \,\, A \, \mbox{ is open}  \} \,.
$$

> Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$: 
>
>  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , \R^n \in \TT$: Indeed $\emptyset$ is open because there is no point $x$ for which (@eq-open-set-Rn) needs to be checked. Moreover $\R^n$ is open because (@eq-open-set-Rn) holds with any radius $r>0$. 
>  - (A2) Let $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$ and define the union set
>  $$
>  A:=\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \,.
>  $$
>  We need to check that $A$ is open. Let $x \in A$. By definition of union, there exists an index $i_0 \in I$ such that
>  $x \in A_{i_0}$. Since $A_{i_0}$ is open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exists $r>0$ such that 
>  $B_r(x) \subset A_{i_0}$. As $A_{i_0} \subset A$, we conclude that $B_r(x) \subset A$. Thus $A$ is open and $A \in \TT$.
>
> - (A3) Let $A, B \in \TT$. 
>  We need to check that $A \cap B$ is open. Let $x \in A \cap B$. Therefore $x \in A$ and $x \in B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exist $r_1,r_2>0$ such that 
>  $B_{r_1}(x) \subset A$ and $B_{r_2}(x) \subset B$. Set $r := \min\{ r_1,r_2\}$. Then

>  Hence $B_r(x) \subset A \cap B$, showing that $A \cap B$ open, so that $A \cap B \in \TT$.

Let us make a basic bus useful observation: balls in $\R^n$ are open for the Euclidean topology.


::: {.Proposition   #proposition-balls-open}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology. Let $r>0$ and $x \in \R^n$. Then
$$
B_r(x) \in \TT \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We need to shown that $B_r(x)$ satisfies @eq-open-set-Rn. Therefore, let $y \in B_r(x)$. In particular
$$
\norm{x - y}<r \,.
$${#eq-balls-open}
Define 
$$
\e := r - \norm{x - y} \,.
$$
Note that $\e>0$ by (@eq-balls-open). We claim that 
$$
B_{\e} (y) \subset B_r (x) \,,
$$
see @fig-balls-open. Indeed, let $z \in B_{\e}(y)$. By triangle inequality we have
$$
\| z - x \| \leq \norm{ x - y } + \norm{ y - z } <  \norm{ x - y } + \e = r \,, 
$$
where we used that $\norm{y - z} < \e$ and the definition of $\e$.

## Convergence

We have generalized the notion of open set to arbitrary sets. Next we generalize
the notion of convergence of sequences.

::: Definition
### Convergent sequence

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological. Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n \in \N} \subset X$ and a point
$x \in X$. We say that $x_n$ converges to $x_0$ if the following property holds:
$$
\forall \, U \in \TT  \st x_0 \in U\,, \,\, \exists \, N = N(U) \in \N \st  x_n \in U \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$ {#eq-convergence}

:::


::: Notation

The convergence of $x_n$ to $x_0$ is denoted by 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0 \,.
$$

:::


Let us analyze the definition of convergence in the topologies we have encountered so far. We will have that:

- **Trivial topology**: Every sequence converges to every point.
- **Discrete topology**: A sequence converges if and only if it is eventually constant.
- **Euclidean topology**: Topological convergence coincides with classical notion of convergence.

We now precisely state and prove the above claims.

::: Proposition
### Convergence for trivial topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. Then 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

To show that $x_n \to x_0$ we need to check that (@eq-convergence) holds. Therefore, let 
$U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$. We have two cases:

- $U = \emptyset$:  This case is not possible, since $x_0$ cannot be in $U$. 

- $U = X$: Take $N=1$. Since $U$ is the whole space, then $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq 1$.  

As these are all the open sets, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Proposition
### Convergence for discrete topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ A  \divider A \subset X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$.
2. $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
:::



::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume that $x_n \to x_0$.*

We have to prove that $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant. To this end, let 
$$
U = \{x_0\} \,.
$$
Then $U \in \TT$. Since $x_n \to x_0$, by (@eq-convergence) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = \{x_0\}$, the above is saying that $x_n = x_0$ for all $n \geq N$. Hence $x_n$ is eventually constant. 


*Part 2. Assume that $x_n$ is eventually equal to $x_0$.*

By assumption there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-convergence-discrete}
Let $U \in \TT$ be an open set such that $x_0 \in U$. By (@eq-convergence-discrete) we have
that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::


::: Proposition
### Convergence for Euclidean topology

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology.
Let $\{x_n\} \subset \R^n$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in \R^n$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
2. $x_n \to x_0$ in $\R^n$, that is,
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \norm{x_n - x_0}  = 0 \,. 
$$
:::







## Metric spaces



::: Definition 
### Metric space

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$$
d \colon X \times X \to \R
$$
such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

1. The distance is non-negative
$$
d(x,y) \geq 0 \,.
$$ 
Moreover $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x=y$.

2. The distance is symmetric:
$$
d(x,y) = d(y,x) \,.
$$

3. The triangle inequality holds:
$$
d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z) \,.
$$


We say that the pair $(X,d)$ is a **metric space**.
:::







::: Definition
### Topology induced by the metric

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We define the topology $\TT$ **induced by the metric** as the
collection of sets $U \subset X$ that satisfy the following property:
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subset U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$. This is defined by 
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$


:::














## Connected topological spaces



::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are just $\emptyset$ and $X$.
