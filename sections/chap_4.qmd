# Curvature and Torsion

We have seen how to describe curves and reparametrized them. Now we want to look at local properties of curves:

- How much does a curve twist?
- How much does a curve bend?

We will measure two quantities:

- **Curvature**: measures how much a curve $\g$ deviates from a straight line.
- **Torsion**: measures how much a curve $\g$ fails to lie on a plane.

For example a 2D spiral is curved, but still lies in a plane. Instead the Helix both deviates from a straight line and *pulls away* from any fixed plane. 



## Curvature 

We start with an informal discussion. Suppose $\g$ is a straight line
$$
\g(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{v}
$$
with $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{v} \in \R^3$. The tangent vector to $\g$ is constant
$$
\dot\g(t) =  \mathbf{v} \,.
$$
Whatever the definition of curvature will be, it has to hold that $\g$ has zero curvature in this case. If we further derive the tangent vector, we obtain
$$
\ddot\g(t) =  0 \,.
$$
Thus $\ddot \g$ seems to be a good candidate for the definition of curvature of $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$.  


Suppose now that $\g$ is a curve in $\R^2$ with unit speed. We have proven that in this case
$$
\dot \g \cdot \ddot\g = 0 \,,
$$
that is, the vector $\ddot \g$ is orthogonal to the tangent $\dot \g$ at all times. Now let $\mathbf{n}(t)$ be the unit vector orthogonal to $\dot \g(t)$ at the point $\g(t)$. The amount that the curve $\g$ deviates from its tangent at $\g(t)$ after time $t_0$ is
$$
( \g(t + t_0) - \g(t) ) \cdot \mathbf{n}(t) \,,
$$ {#eq-curvature-heuristics}
as seen in the figure below.


![Amount that $\g$ deviates from tangent is $(\g(t+t_0)-\g(t)) \cdot \nn(t)$](/images/curvature.png){width=70%}


Equation (@eq-curvature-heuristics) is what we take as measure of curvature. Since 
$$
\dot \g(t) \cdot \ddot \g(t) = 0 \quad \mbox{ and } \quad   \dot \g(t) \cdot \mathbf{n}(t)= 0 \,,
$$
we conclude that $\ddot \g(t)$ is parallel to $\mathbf{n}(t)$. Since $\mathbf{n}(t)$ is a unit vector, there exists a scalar $\kappa(t)$ such that 
$$
\ddot \g(t)  = \kappa(t) \, \mathbf{n}(t) \,.
$$
Note that, since $\nn$ is unitary, we have
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddot \g(t) }
$$


Now, approximate $\g$ at $t$ with its second order Taylor polynomial:
$$
\g(t+t_0) = \g(t) + \dot\g(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddot\g(t)}{2} t_0^2 + o(t_0)
$$
with the remainder $o(t_0)$ is such that 
$$
\lim_{t_0 \to 0} \ \frac{o(t_0)}{t_0^2} = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore, forgetting about the remainder, 
$$
\g(t+t_0) - \g(t) \approx \dot\g(t) t_0 + \frac{\ddot\g(t)}{2} t_0^2 \,.
$$
Multiplying by $\nn(t)$ we get
$$
(\g(t+t_0) - \g(t)) \cdot \nn(t) \approx \dot\g(t) \cdot \nn(t) t_0 + 
\frac{\ddot\g(t) \cdot \nn(t) }{2} t_0^2\,.
$$
Recalling that 
$$
\dot\g(t) \cdot \nn(t) = 0\,, \quad  \ddot\g(t) \cdot \nn(t) = \kappa(t) \,, 
$$
we then obtain
$$
(\g(t+t_0) - \g(t)) \cdot \nn(t) \approx 
\frac{1}{2} \, \kappa(t) \, t_0^2
$$


::: Important

The amount that $\g$ deviates from a straight line is proportional to 
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{\ddot \g (t)}\,.
$$

:::

We take this as definition of curvature for a general unit speed curve in $\R^n.$


::: Definition 

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a unit speed curve. The **curvature** of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is
$$
\kappa(t) := \norm{\ddot \g (t)} \,.
$$

:::



Note that $\kappa(t)$ is a function of time. Therefore the curvature of $\g$ can change from point to point.


::: Example

Consider the circle of radius $R>0$:
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t),R\sin(t)) \,, \quad t \in [0,2\pi] \,.
$$
To compute the curvature of $\g$ we need to find a unit speed reparametrization. We have shown that:
$$
\g \, \mbox{ regular } \,\,\, \implies \,\,\, \f = s^{-1} \, \mbox{ unit speed reparametrization}
$$
where $s$ is the arc length of $\g$:
$$
s(t):= \int_{t_0}^t \norm{\dot \g(\tau)} \, d\tau  \,.
$$
In our case 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t))  \quad \implies \quad 
\norm{\dot \g(t)} = R  
$$
and so $\g$ is regular. The arc length starting at $t_0 = 0$ is
$$
s(t) = \int_{0}^t R d \tau = t R \,.
$$
The inverse of $s$ is
$$
\f(t) := s^{-1} (t) = \frac{t}{R} \,.
$$
Therefore a unit speed reparametrization of $\g$ is 
$$
\tg :=\g \circ \f 
$$
which reads
$$
\tg(t) :=  \left( R \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) , R \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right) \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align}
\dot{\tg} (t) & =  \left( - \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right) \\
\ddot{\tg} (t) & =  \left( -\frac{1}{R} \cos \left( \frac{t}{R} \right) ,  - \frac{1}{R} \sin \left( \frac{t}{R} \right)\right)
\end{align}
Therefore the curvature of $\g$ is
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddot{\tg} (t) } = \frac{1}{R} \,.
$$
In this case $\kappa(t)$ is constant. The curvature also tells us that the smaller the circle, the higher the curvature. For a large circle, like the Earth, the curvature is barely noticeable. 
:::



The curvature is defined for unit speed curves. To circumvent this, in the above example we computed a unit length reparametrization of the circle, and then computed the curvature of the reparametrization.  
If $\g$ is a regular curve, then one could do the same: first compute unit speed reparametrization $\tg$, and from this compute the curvature. When $\g$ is regular and has values in $\R^3$, there is a way to compute $\kappa$ without reparametrizing. To do this, we will need the notion of **cross product**, or **vector product** .

## Vector product in $\R^3$





## Curvature formula


Given a unit speed curve
$$
\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n
$$
we defined its curvature as
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddot{\g}(t) } \,.
$$
If $\g$ is not unit speed then the curvature is not defined. However, when $\g$ is regular, then we can find a unit-speed reparametrization $\tg$ of $\g$, and compute $\kappa$ as
$$
\kappa(t) = \norm{ \ddot{\tg}(t) } \,.
$$
If $\g$ is a regular curve in $\R^3$, there is a way to compute $\kappa$ without passing through $\tg$. The formula for computing $\kappa$ is as follows. 

::: Proposition

Let $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ be a regular curve. Then the curvature $\kappa(t)$ of $\g$ at $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\kappa(t) = \frac{ \norm{\ddot \g \times \dot \g} }{ \norm{\dot \g}^3 } \,. 
$$

We delay the proof of the above Proposition, as this will get easier when the **Frenet frame** is introduced. For a proof which does not make use of the Frenet frame, see the proof of Proposition 2.1.2 in [@pressley].

For now, we use the above proposition to compute the curvature on specific curves.

::: Example

Consider the Helix
$$
\g (t) = ( \cos(t) , \sin(t) , t) \,, \quad t \in \R \,.
$$

## Plane curves

The signed curvature is the rate at which the tangent vector $\dot \g$ of the curve $\g$ rotates. The signed curvature is:

- positive if $\dot \g$ is rotating anticlockwise
- negative if $\dot \g$ is rotating clockwise

A rigorous justification of the above statement is found in Proposition 2.2.3 in [@pressley].





We do not prove the above theorem. For a proof, see Theorem 2.2.6 in [@pressley].
