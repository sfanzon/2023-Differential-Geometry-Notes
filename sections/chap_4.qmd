# Surfaces


Curves are 1D objects in $\R^3$, parametrized via functions $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$. 
There is only one available direction in which to move on a curve:

- $t \mapsto \g(t)$ moves forward on the curve 
- $t \mapsto \g(-t)$ moves backward on the curve

Surfaces are 2D objects in $\R^3$. There are two directions in which one can move on a surface.

::: Question

How to dercribe a surface mathematically?

:::


A curve $\Gamma \subseteq \R^3$ can be described with one function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$. The idea is that $\Gamma$ looks locally like $\R$.


![A curve $\Gamma$ can be described by a function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$.](/images/curves_example_2.png){width=60%}


A surface $\SSS$ cannot be described, in general, with just one function $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$, with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open set. The idea is that, to describe $\SSS$, one needs to piece together many local **charts** $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open. Such charts have to cover the whole surface $\SSS$, e.g.
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$

## Preliminaries


Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we need to establish
some basic notation and terminology regarding the topology of $\R^n$ and smooth maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.



### Topology of $\R^n$


The Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ is denoted by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 }\,, \quad \xx = (x_1 , \ldots, x_n) \in \R^n \,.
$$
The Euclidean norm induces the distance
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \| \xx - \yy \| =   \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 } \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Euclidean Topology 

The pair $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space. The topology induced by the metric $d$ is called the Euclidean topology, denoted by $\TT$. In this chapter we will always assume that $\R^n$ is equipped with the Euclidean topology $\TT$.

:::


::: Definition 
### Open Sets

A set $U \subseteq \R^n$ is open if for all $\xx \in U$ there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx) \subseteq U$, where
$$
B_{\e}(\xx) := \{  \yy \in \R^n \divider \| \xx - \yy  \| < \e   \}
$$
is the open ball of radius $\e>0$ and centered at $\xx$. In this case we denote $U \in \TT$, with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology in $\R^n$.

:::



::: Definition 
### Closed Sets 

A set $V \subseteq \R^n$ is closed if $V^c := \R^n \smallsetminus U$ is open. 

:::




::: Example

- The $n$-dimensional unit sphere
$$
\sphere^n = \{ \xx \in \R^{n+1} \divider \| x \| = 1 \}
$$
is not open in $\R^{n+1}$, since for any $\xx \in \sphere^n$ we have
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq \sphere^{n} \,. 
$$

- The $n$-dimensional unit cube 
$$
C := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| <1  \}
$$
is open in $\R^n$, since one can always find $\e>0$ small enough so that
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq C \,. 
$$

- The set 
$$
V := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \geq 1  \}
$$
is closed, since $V^c = C$ is the unit cube, which is open.

:::



::: Definition 
### Subspace Topology

Given a subset $A \subseteq \R^n$ the subspace topology on $A$ is the family of sets
$$
\TT_A := \{  U \subseteq A \divider \exists \,\, W \in \TT \st U = A \cap W  \} \,.
$$
If $U \in \TT_A$ we say that $U$ is open in $A$.

:::





### Smooth functions


We recall some basic facts about smooth functions from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$. For a vector valued function $f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ we denote its components by 
$$
f = (f_1,\ldots,f_m) \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Continuous Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx \in U$ if $\forall \, \e>0$, \, $\exists \, \delta > 0$ such that 
$$
\|  \xx - \yy  \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad 
\| f(\xx) - f (\yy) \| < \e \,.
$$
We say that $f$ is continuous in $U$ if it is continuous for all $\xx \in U$.
:::


::: Remark

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$, with $U,V$ open. We have that $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $U$, for all $A$ open in $V$.

:::


::: Definition
### Homeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$ with $U,V$ open. We say that $f$ is a homeomorphism if $f$ is continuous and there exists inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$ continuous.

:::



::: Definition
### Differentiable Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $\xx \in U$ if there exists a linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ such that
$$
\lim_{\e \to 0} \   \frac{ f(\xx + \e \pmb{h} )  - f(\xx) - \e \, df_{\xx}(\pmb{h}) }{ \e } = 0 \,,
$$
for all $\pmb{h} \in \R^n$, where the limit is taken in $\R^m$. The map $df_{\xx}$ is called the **differential** of $f$ at $\xx$. 

:::


We denote by $\{\ee_i\}_{i=1}^n$ the standard basis of $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Partial Derivative

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open be differentiable. The partial derivative of $f$ at $\xx \in U$ in direction $\ee_i$ is given by
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} := \lim_{\e \to 0}  \frac{ f( \xx + \e \ee_i ) - f(\xx) }{ \e } \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition
### Jacobian Matrix

The linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ can be represented in matrix form, with respect to the Euclidean basis, by the Jacobian matrix
$$
Jf(x):= \left( \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} \right)_{i,j}  \in \R^{m \times n} \,.
$$
If $m=n$ then $Jf \in \R^{n \times n}$ is a square matrix and we can compute its determinant, denoted by
$$
\det Jf \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition
### Multi-index notation

For a multi-index
$$
\alpha := (\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n) \in \N^n
$$
we denote by 
$$
|\alpha|:= \sum_{i=1}^n   |\alpha_i|
$$
the length of the multi-index. 

:::




::: Definition
### Smooth Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is smooth if the derivatives 
$$
\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} f}{d\xx^\alpha} :=  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{ \partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{ \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} \, f
$$
exist for each multi-index $\alpha \in \N^n$. Note that in this case all the derivatives of $f$ are automatically continuous.

:::




::: Notation
### Gradient and partial derivatives

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ be smooth. We denote the partial derivatives by 
$$
\partial_{x_i} f := \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \,, \quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j} f := \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \,,
\quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j x_k} f := \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k} \,.
$$

For $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ smooth we denote the **gradient** by
$$
\nabla f (\xx) = \left(  f_{x_1}(\xx) , \ldots ,  f_{x_n}(\xx) \right) \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

The functions $f \colon \R^2 \to \R$ and $g \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ defined by
$$
f(x,y) := \cos(x)y \,, \quad 
g(x,y) := (x^2,y^2,x-y)
$$
are both smooth.

:::



::: Definition
### Diffeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \to V$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $V \subseteq \R^n$ open. We say that $f$ is a **diffeomorphism** between $U$ and $V$ if $f$ is smooth and there exists 
smooth inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$.

:::



We recall, without proof, the Inverse Function Theorem. Please note that in the statement the function $f$ is defined from $\R^n$ into $\R^n$.



::: Theorem
### Inverse Function Theorem

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a smooth function and
$$
\det J f(\xx_0) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for some $\xx_0 \in U$. Then there exist open sets $U_0 , V \subseteq \R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U_0$, $f(\xx_0) \in V$ and $f \colon U_0 \to V$ is a diffeomorphism.


:::


::: Warning 

Even if 
$$
\det J f(\xx) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for all $\xx \in U$, it is not guaranteed that $f$ is a diffeomorphism between $U$ and $f(U)$.

:::


Non-vanishing Jacobian determinant is a necessary condition for being a diffeomorphism.



::: Proposition

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a diffeomorphism on $U$. Then 
$$
\det Jf (\xx) \neq 0 \,, \quad   \forall \, \xx \in \R^n \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

Define $f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2$ by
$$
f(x,y) := (\cos(x) \sin(y), \sin(x) \sin(y)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
J f (x,y) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 - \sin(x) \sin(y)  &   \cos(x) \cos(y) \\
 \cos(x) \sin(y)    &   \sin(x) \cos(y)
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\det Jf(x,y) & = - \sin^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) - \cos^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) \\
             & = - \sin(y) \cos(y) \\
             & = - \frac{1}{2} \sin(2y) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
\det Jf(x,y) \neq 0 \quad \iff \quad 
y \neq \frac{n \pi}{2} \,, \,\, n \in \N \,.
$$
Hence $f$ is a diffeomorphism away from the lines
$$
L_n := \left\{ \left(x, \frac{n \pi}{2} \right) \divider x \in \R \right\} \,.
$$

:::






## Smooth surfaces


We can finally give the definition of smooth surface in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Smooth Surface

Let $\SSS \subseteq \R^3$ be a connected set. We say that $\SSS$ is a **smooth surface** if for every point $\pp \in \SSS$ there exist an open set  $U \subseteq \R^2$ and a smooth map
$$
\sss \colon U \to  \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,
$$
such that 

- $\pp \in \sss(U)$
- $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$
- $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $U$ and $\sss(U)$


Further:

- The homeomorphism $\sss$ is called a **surface chart**. 
- For each $i \in I$ suppose to have a surface chart
$$
\sss_i  \colon U_i \to \sss(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
We say that the family $\{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i \in I} \sss_i(U_i)  \,.
$$


:::




::: Remark

- A surface chart $\sss$ is a map from $\R^2$ into $\R^3$.


- Given a chart $\sss \colon U \to \sss(U)$, the set $U$ is open in $\R^2$ while $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$ with the subspace topology. This means that there exists $W \subseteq \R^3$ open such that
$$
\sss(U) = W \cap \SSS \,.
$$

- The omeomorphism condition is saying that $\sss(U) \subseteq \SSS$ looks locally (around $\pp$) like an open set $U \subseteq \R^2$.

:::

::: Notation

- Points in $U$ will be denoted with the pair $(u,v)$.

- Partial derivatives of a chart $\sss = \sss (u,v)$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss_u := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial u} \,, \quad 
\sss_v := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial v} \,.
$$
Similar notations are adopted for higher order derivatives.

- Components of $\sss$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss = (\sigma^1, \sigma^2, \sigma^3) \,.
$$

:::




::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Planes in $\R^3$ are surfaces with atlas containing one chart. Namely, a plane
$\pi \subseteq \R^3$ is described by
$$
\pi  = \{  \xx  \in \R^3 \divider \xx \cdot \ww = \lambda \} \,.
$$
Let

- $\pp,\pmb{q} \in \R^3$ be ortoghonal to each other and to $\ww$.
- $\pmb{a} \in \pi$ be any point in the plane.


If $\xx \in \pi$ then $\xx-\pmb{a}$ is parallel to the plane and $\pi$ can be
equivalently represented as
$$
\pi = \{ \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} \,.
$$
Define the map
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \pi \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \,.
$$
We have:

- $\sss$ is smooth.
- For each $\xx \in \pi$ we have $\xx \in \sss(\R^2) = \pi$.
- $\sss(\R^2)$ is open in $\pi$, since $\sss(\R^2) = \pi$.
- The inverse of $\sss$ is 
$$
\sss^{-1} \colon \pi \to \R^2 \,, \quad 
\sss^{-1} (\xx) = ( (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pp , (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pmb{q}  ) \,.
$$
- As $\sss^{-1}$ is continuous, then $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $\R^2$ and $\pi$. 

Therefore $\sss$ is a chart for $\pi$. Since
$$
\sss(\R^2) = \pi \,,
$$
we have that $\{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\pi$, and hence $\pi$ is a smooth surface.

### Unit cylinder

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
$\SSS$ is a smooth surface with an atlas consisting of two charts:
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss_i(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)

::: Important


Consider again the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Define the map 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss (u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
where
$$
U:= [ 0, 2 \pi ] \times \R \,.
$$
Clearly we have 
$$
\sss(U) = \SSS \,.
$$
However $\{\sss\}$ is not an atlas for $\SSS$, since $\sss$ is not a chart. This is because $\sss$ is not invertible, as for example
$$
\sss(0,0) = \sss(2\pi,0) \,. 
$$
Therefore $\sss$ cannot be an omeomorphism between $U$ and $\SSS$.



:::




::: Example
### Circular cone

Consider the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} \,.
$$
Then $\SSS$ is not a smooth surface. This is essentially consequence of
the fact that
$$
\SSS \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is a disconnected set.


To see that $\SSS$ is not a smooth surface, suppose there exists an 
atlas $\{\sss_i\}$ of $\SSS$
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \sss_i(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
In particular there exists a chart $\sss_{i_0}$ such that 
$$
\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(U_{i_0}) \,.
$$
Let $\xx_0 \in U_{i_0}$ be the point such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(\xx_0) = \zero \,.
$$
Consider the ball $B_{\e}(\xx_0)$ for any $\e > 0$. Since $\sss_{i_0}$ is a homeomorphism, we deduce that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))
$$
is open in $\SSS$. Hence there exists an open set $W$ in $\R^3$ such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) = \SSS \cap W \,.
$$
As $\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ and $W$ is open in $\R^3$, it follows that
$W$ contains points of both $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, with
$$
\SSS^- := \SSS \cap \{ z < 0 \}   \,, \quad
\SSS^+ := \SSS \cap \{ z > 0 \}   \,.
$$

>This is because $W$ contains a ball of suitable radius $\delta>0$ and centered at $\zero$.

Hence $\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ contains points of $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, implying that 
$$
V := \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is disconnected, with disconnection given by
$$
V = ( V \cap \SSS^- ) \cup (V \cap \SSS^+) \,.
$$
However $V$ is homeomorphic to 
$$
B_{\e} (\xx_0) \smallsetminus \{ \xx_0 \} \,,
$$
which is instead connected. Contradiction. Hence $\SSS$ is not a smooth surface.

## Regular Surfaces


Recall that we had defined a regular curve to be a map $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ such that
$$
\norm{\g(t)} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
This allowed us to define tangent vectors and, eventually, Frenet frame.
We want to do something similar for smooth surfaces.



::: Definition
### Regular Surfaces

Regular if the differential $d\sss_{\xx} \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is injective for all $\xx \in \R^2$. If we represent the differential as a matrix, with respect to the standard basis, we get the Jacobian
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
Injectivity of $d\sss$ corresponds to $J\sss$ having rank-2. This means that
the vectors $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. 
In coordinates 

Let $U \subset \R^2$ be open A surface chart 
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v)  \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called **regular** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
