# Topology


So far we have worked in $\R^n$, where for example we have the notions of open set, continuous function and compact set. Topology is what allows us to extend these notions to arbitrary sets.



::: Definition
### Topological space   {#definition-topology}

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if the following 3 properties hold:

- (A1) We have $\emptyset, X \in \TT$,

- (A2) If $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$, then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- (A3) If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

Further, we say:

- The pair $(X,\TT)$ is a **topological space**.
- The elements of $X$ are called **points**.
- The sets in the topology $\TT$ are called **open sets**.
:::




::: {.Remark  #remark-intersection}

The intersection property of $\TT$, Property (A3) in Definition \ref{definition-topology}, is 
equivalent to the following:

- (A3') If $A_1, \ldots, A_M \in \TT$ for some $M \in \N$, then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^M A_n  \in \TT \,.
$$

> The equivalence between (A3) and (A3') can be immediately obtained by induction.

:::





::: Warning

Notice:

- The union property (A2) of $\TT$ holds for an **arbitrary** number of sets, even uncountable!
- The intersection property (A3') of $\TT$ holds only for a **finite** number of sets. 

:::



There are two main examples of topologies that one should always keep in mind. 
These are:

- **Trivial topology**: The topology with the smallest possible number of sets.
- **Discrete topology**: The topology with the highest possible number of sets.




::: Definition
### Trivial topology

Let $X$ be a set. The trivial topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{  \emptyset , X \} \,.
$$

> Let us check that $\TT$ is indeed a topology. We need to verify the 3 properties of a topology:
>
>  - (A1) We clearly have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$.
>  - (A2) The only non-trivial union to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cup X = X \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>  - (A3) The only non-trivial intersection to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cap X = \emptyset \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::





::: Definition
### Discrete topology

Let $X$ be a set. The discrete topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subseteq X \} \,,
$$
that is, every subset of $X$ is open.

> Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology: 
>
>  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$, since $\emptyset$ and $X$ are subsets of $X$.
>  - (A2) The arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$.
>
>  - (A3) The intersection of two subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  A \cap B \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A, B  \in \TT$.
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::




We anticipated that topology is the extension of familiar concepts of open set, continuity, etc.
that we have in $\R^n$. Let us see how the usual definition of open set of $\R^n$ can fit
in our new abstract framework of topology. 



::: Definition
### Open set of $\R^n$

Let $A \subseteq \R^n$. We say that the set $A$ is **open** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \xx \in A \,, \,\, \exists \, r > 0 \st B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \,,
$${#eq-open-set-Rn}
where $B_r(\xx)$ is the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $\xx$
$$
B_r(\xx) := \{ \yy \in \R^n \divider \norm{ \yy - \xx } < r  \} \,, 
$$
and the **Euclidean norm** of $\xx \in \R^n$ is defined by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^2 } \,.
$$

See @fig-open-set-Rn for a schematic picture of an open set.
:::



![The set $A \subseteq \R^n$ is open if for every $\xx \in A$ there exists $r>0$ such that $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A$.](/images/open_set_R.png){#fig-open-set-Rn width=70%}



::: Definition
### Euclidean topology of $\R^n$  {#definition-euclidean-topology}

The Euclidean topology on $\R^n$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subseteq \R^n \,, \,\, A \, \mbox{ is open}  \} \,.
$$

:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, in the sense that we have to
prove that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.


::: Proof
### Well-posedness of Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}

Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$: 

  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , \R^n \in \TT$: Indeed $\emptyset$ is open because there is no point $\xx$ for which (@eq-open-set-Rn) needs to be checked. Moreover $\R^n$ is open because (@eq-open-set-Rn) holds with any radius $r>0$. 
  - (A2) Let $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$ and define the union set
  $$
  A:=\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \,.
  $$
  We need to check that $A$ is open. Let $\xx \in A$. By definition of union, there exists an index $i_0 \in I$ such that
  $\xx \in A_{i_0}$. Since $A_{i_0}$ is open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exists $r>0$ such that 
  $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A_{i_0}$. As $A_{i_0} \subseteq A$, we conclude that $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A$. Thus $A$ is open and $A \in \TT$.

 - (A3) Let $A, B \in \TT$. 
  We need to check that $A \cap B$ is open. Let $\xx \in A \cap B$. Therefore $\xx \in A$ and $\xx \in B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exist $r_1,r_2>0$ such that 
  $B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A$ and $B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B$. Set $r := \min\{ r_1,r_2\}$. Then 
  $$
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A  \,, \quad 
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B  \,, 
  $$
  Hence $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \cap B$, showing that $A \cap B$ open, so that $A \cap B \in \TT$.

 This proves that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.
:::



Let us make a basic bus useful observation: balls in $\R^n$ are open for the Euclidean topology.


::: {.Proposition   #proposition-balls-open}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology. Let $r>0$ and $\xx \in \R^n$. Then
$$
B_r(\xx) \in \TT \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We need to shown that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn). Therefore, let $\yy \in B_r(\xx)$. In particular
$$
\norm{\xx - \yy}<r \,.
$${#eq-balls-open}
Define 
$$
\e := r - \norm{\xx - \yy} \,.
$$
Note that $\e>0$ by (@eq-balls-open). We claim that 
$$
B_{\e} (\yy) \subseteq B_r (\xx) \,,
$${#eq-proof-ball-open}
see @fig-balls-open. Indeed, let $\zz \in B_{\e}(\yy)$. By triangle inequality we have
$$
\| \zz - \xx \| \leq \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \norm{ \yy - \zz } <  \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \e = r \,, 
$$
where we used that $\norm{\yy - \zz} < \e$ and the definition of $\e$. Hence $\zz \in B_r(\xx)$, proving 
(@eq-proof-ball-open). This proves that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn), and is therefore
open.


:::


![The ball $B_{\e}(\yy)$ is contained in $B_r(\xx)$ if $\e := r - \norm{\xx-\yy}$.](/images/balls_open.png){#fig-balls-open width=70%}









## Closed sets



The opposite of open sets are closed sets.


::: Definition 
### Closed set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. A set $C \subseteq X$ is **closed**
if 
$$
C^c   \in \TT \,, 
$$
where $C^c:= X \smallsetminus C$ is the complement of $C$ in $X$.
:::


In words, a set is closed if its complement is open. 


::: Warning

There are sets which are neither open nor closed. For example consider $\R$ equipped with Euclidean topology. Then the interval
$$
A:=[0,1) 
$$
is neither open nor closed.

> For the moment we do not have the tools to prove this. We will have them shortly. 

:::


We could have defined a topology starting from closed sets. We would
have had to replace the properties (A1)-(A2)-(A3) with suitable properties for closed sets. This is detailed in the following proposition.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. Properties (A1)-(A2)-(A3) of $\TT$ are equivalent to (C1)-(C2)-(C3), where

- (C1) $\emptyset, X$ are closed.
- (C2) If $C_i$ is closed for all $i \in I$, then
$$
\bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i
$$
is closed.
- (C3) If $C_1,C_2$ are closed then
$$
C_1 \cup C_2
$$
is closed.

:::


::: Proof

We have 3 points to check:

- The equivalence between (A1) and (C1) is clear, since
$$
\emptyset^c = X \,, \quad X^c = \emptyset \,.
$$

- Suppose $C_i$ are closed for all $i \in I$. Therefore $C_i^c$ are open for all $i \in I$. By De Morgan's laws we have that
$$
\left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i \right)^c =  \bigcup_{i \in I} \, C_i^c 
$$
showing that
$$
\bigcap_{i \in I} \, C_i  \, \mbox{ is closed} \quad 
\iff \quad 
\bigcup_{i \in I} \, C_i^c  \, \mbox{ is open} \,.
$$
Therefore (A2) and (C2) are equivalent.

- Suppose $C_1,C_2$ are closed. Therefore $C_1^c, C_2^c$ are open. By De Morgan's laws we have that
$$
\left(  C_1 \cup  C_2 \right)^c =  C_1^c \cap C_2^c 
$$
showing that
$$
C_1 \cup  C_2 \, \mbox{ is closed} \quad 
\iff \quad 
 C_1^c \cap C_2^c  \, \mbox{ is open} \,.
$$
Therefore (A3) and (C3) are equivalent.
:::





## Comparing topologies




Consider the situation where you have two topologies $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ on the same 
set $X$. We would like to have some notions of comparison between $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$.


::: Definition
### Finer and coarser topology

Let $X$ be a set and let $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Suppose that
$$
\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1 \,.
$$
We say that:

- $\TT_1$ is **finer** than $\TT_2$.
- $\TT_2$ is **coarser** than $\TT_1$.

If it holds 
$$
\TT_2 \subsetneq \TT_1 \,,
$$
we say that:

- $\TT_1$ is **strictly finer** than $\TT_2$.
- $\TT_2$ is **strictly coarser** than $\TT_1$.

We say that $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ are the **same** topology if
$$
\TT_1 = \TT_2 \,.
$$
:::




::: Example

Let $X$ be a set and consider the trivial and discrete topologies
$$
\TT_{\textrm{trivial}} = \{ \emptyset, X\} \,, \quad \TT_{\textrm{discrete}} = \{ A \divider A \subseteq X \} \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\TT_{\textrm{trivial}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{discrete}} \,,
$$
so that $\TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$ is strictly finer than $\TT_{\textrm{trivial}}$.


:::


Another interesting example is given by the **cofinite topology** on 
$\R$. The sets in this topology are open if they are either empty, or coincide with $\R$ with a finite number of points removed.


::: Example
### Cofinite topology on $\R$



Consider the following family $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ of subsets of $\R$
$$
\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} := \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \}\,. 
$$
Then $(\R,\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}})$ is a topological space, and $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ is called the **cofinite topology**. We have that
$$
\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,.
$$



> Exercise: Show that $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}}$ is a topology on $\R$ and that $\TT_{\textrm{cofinite}} \subsetneq \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}}$.

:::





## Convergence

We have generalized the notion of open set to arbitrary sets. Next we generalize
the notion of convergence of sequences.

::: Definition
### Convergent sequence

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological. Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n \in \N} \subseteq X$ and a point
$x \in X$. We say that $x_n$ converges to $x_0$ if the following property holds:
$$
\forall \, U \in \TT  \st x_0 \in U\,, \,\, \exists \, N = N(U) \in \N \st  x_n \in U \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$ {#eq-convergence}

:::


::: Notation

The convergence of $x_n$ to $x_0$ is denoted by 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0 \,.
$$

:::


Let us analyze the definition of convergence in the topologies we have encountered so far. We will have that:

- **Trivial topology**: Every sequence converges to every point.
- **Discrete topology**: A sequence converges if and only if it is eventually constant.
- **Euclidean topology**: Topological convergence coincides with classical notion of convergence.



We now precisely state and prove the above claims.

::: Proposition
### Convergence for trivial topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. Then 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

To show that $x_n \to x_0$ we need to check that (@eq-convergence) holds. Therefore, let 
$U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$. We have two cases:

- $U = \emptyset$:  This case is not possible, since $x_0$ cannot be in $U$. 

- $U = X$: Take $N=1$. Since $U$ is the whole space, then $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq 1$.  

As these are all the open sets, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Warning

This example is saying that in general the topological limit of a sequence is **not unique**!

:::



::: Proposition
### Convergence for discrete topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ A  \divider A \subseteq X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$.
2. $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
:::



::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume that $x_n \to x_0$.*

We have to prove that $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant. To this end, let 
$$
U = \{x_0\} \,.
$$
Then $U \in \TT$. Since $x_n \to x_0$, by (@eq-convergence) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = \{x_0\}$, the above is saying that $x_n = x_0$ for all $n \geq N$. Hence $x_n$ is eventually constant. 


*Part 2. Assume that $x_n$ is eventually equal to $x_0$.*

By assumption there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-convergence-discrete}
Let $U \in \TT$ be an open set such that $x_0 \in U$. By (@eq-convergence-discrete) we have
that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::


Before proceeding to examining convergence in the Euclidean topology, let us recall the 
classical definition of convergence in $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Classical convergence in $\R^n$

Let $\{\xx_n\} \subseteq \R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. We say that $\xx_n$ converges $\xx_0$ in the 
classical sense if 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \norm{\xx_n - \xx_0}  = 0 \,. 
$$
The above is equivalent to: For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$


:::


::: Proposition
### Convergence for Euclidean topology  {#proposition-convergence-Rn}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology.
Let $\{\xx_n\} \subseteq \R^n$ be a sequence and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
2. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.*

Fix $\e>0$ and consider the set
$$
U := B_{\e}(\xx_0) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-balls-open} we know that $U \in \TT$. Moreover $\xx_0 \in U$.
By the convergence $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = B_{\e}(\xx_0)$, the above reads
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
showing that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.


*Part 2. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.*


Let $U \in \TT$ be such that $\xx_0 \in U$. By definition of Euclidean topology, this means that 
there exists $r>0$ such that 
$$
B_r(\xx_0) \subseteq U \,.
$$
As $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < r \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
\xx_n \in B_{r}(\xx_0) \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $B_r(\xx_0) \subseteq U$, we have proven that
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ is arbitrary, we conclude that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
:::


::: Notation

Since classical convergence in $\R^n$ agrees with topological convergence with respect to $\TT$, we will just say that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in $\R^n$ without ambiguity.

:::




We conclude with a useful proposition which relates convergences 
when multiple topologies are present.


::: Proposition

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT_1,\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Suppose that
$$
\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1 \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ and $x_0 \in X$. We have
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in } \,\, \TT_1  \quad \implies
\quad 
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in } \,\, \TT_2 \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof
Assume $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_1$. We need to prove that $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_2$. Therefore, let $U \in \TT_2$ be such that $x_0 \in U$. Since $\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1$, we have that $U \in \TT_1$. As  $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_1$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U \in \TT_2$, the above proves $x_n \to x_0$ in $\TT_2$.


:::






## Metric spaces


We will now define a class of topological spaces known as metric spaces.




::: Definition 
### Distance

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$$
d \colon X \times X \to \R
$$
such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

- (M1) Positivity: The distance is non-negative
$$
d(x,y) \geq 0 \,.
$$ 
Moreover 
$$
d(x,y) = 0 \quad \iff x=y \,.
$$

- (M2) Symmetry: The distance is symmetric
$$
d(x,y) = d(y,x) \,.
$$

- (M3) Triangle Inequality: It holds
$$
d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z) \,.
$$
:::




::: Definition
### Metric space

Let $X$ be a set and $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ be a distance on $X$. 
We say that the pair $(X,d)$ is a **metric space**.
:::




::: Example
### $\R^n$ as metric space

The Euclidean norm naturally induces a distance over $\R^n$ by setting
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \norm{ \xx - \yy } \,.
$$
Then $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

> It is trivial to check that the Euclidean distance satisfies (M1) and (M2). 
> To show (M3), recalling the triangle inequality in $\R^n$:
$$
\| \xx + \yy \| \leq \| \xx \|   + \| \yy \| \,,
$$
for all $\xx , \yy \in \R^n$. Using the above we obtain
\begin{align*}
d(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \| \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \| \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \| + \| \zz - \yy \|  \\
             & = d (\xx,\zz) + d (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d$ satisfies (M3). This prove that $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

:::



::: Example
### $p$-distance on $\R^n$


For $\xx,\yy \in \R^n$ and $p \in [1,\infty)$ define 
$$
d_p ( \xx, \yy ) := \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p   \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Note that $d_2$ coincides with the Euclidean distance.
For $p = \infty$ we set
$$
d_{\infty} ( \xx, \yy ) := \max_{i = 1 \ldots, n} |x_i - y_i|  \,.
$$
We have that $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space. 

> Indeed properties (M1)-(M2) hold trivially. The triangle inequality is also 
> trivially satisfied by $d_{\infty}$. We are left with checking the triangle inequality
> for $d_p$ with $p \geq 1$. To this end, define
$$
\| \xx \|_p :=  \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p  \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Minkowski's inequality, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality), states that 
$$
\| \xx + \yy \|_p \leq   \| \xx  \|_p  +  \|  \yy \|_p \,,
$$
for all $\xx ,\yy \in \R^n$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
d_p(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \|_p \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \|_p + \| \zz - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = d_p (\xx,\zz) + d_p (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d_p$ satisfies (M3). Hence $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space.
:::




A metric $d$ on a set $X$ naturally induces a topology which is **compatible** with the metric.



::: Definition
### Topology induced by the metric  {#definition-metric-topology}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We define the topology $\TT_d$ **induced by the metric** $d$ as the
collection of sets $U \subseteq X$ that satisfy the following property:
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subseteq U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$. This is defined by 
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$


:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, that is, we need to show 
that $\TT_d$ is actually a topology on $X$. The proof follows, line by line, the proof that the Euclidean topology is indeed a topology, see proof immediately below Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}. This is left
as an exercise.











::: Example
### Topology induced by Euclidean distance

Consider the metric space $(\R^n,d)$ with $d$ the Euclidean distance. Then 
$$
\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{euclidean}} \,,
$$
where $\TT_{\textrm{euclidean}}$ is the Euclidean topology on $\R^n$. 

> Exercise: Prove the above statement. It is an immediate consequence of definitions.
:::



::: Example
### Discrete distance

Let $X$ be a set. Define the function $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ by
$$
d(x,y) := 
\begin{cases}
	0 & \mbox{ if } \, x = y \\
	1 & \mbox{ if } \, x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$
Then $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and $d$ is called the **discrete distance**. Moreover 
$$
\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{discrete}}

The following proposition tells us that balls in a metric space $X$
are open sets. Moreover balls are the building blocks of all 
open sets in $X$. The proof is left as an exercise.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-metric-ball}


Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then:

- For all $x \in X$, $r>0$ we have $B_r(x) \subseteq \TT_d$.
- $U \in \TT_d$ if and only if
$$
U = \bigcup_{ i \in I } B_{r_i}(x_i) \,,

with $I$ family of indices and $x_i \in X$, $r_i > 0$.

We now define the concept of equivalent metrics.


::: Definition
### Equivalent metrics

Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. We say that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are
equivalent if
$$
\TT_{d_1} = \TT_{d_2} \,.
$$

:::


The following proposition gives a practical way to check if two metrics are equivalent.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-equivalent-metrics}


Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. They are equivalent:

1. $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equivalent metrics.
2. There exists a constant $\alpha > 0$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{\alpha} \, d_2 (x,y) \leq d_1 (x,y) \leq \alpha \, d_2(x,y) \,, \quad \forall \, x,y \in X \,.
$$


:::


The proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} is trivial, and is left as an exercise.




::: Example

Let $p > 1$. The metrics $d_p$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ are equivalent.

> This follows from Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} and the estimate
$$
d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \leq d_p (\xx,\yy) \leq n \, d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \,, \quad \forall \xx \,, \, \yy \in \R^n \,.
$$
:::




::: Warning

If two metrics are equivalent, that does not mean they have the same balls. For example the balls of the metrics $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ look very different, see @fig-balls-R2.

We can characterize the convergence of sequences in metric spaces.


::: Proposition
### Convergence in metric space

Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space and denote by $\TT_d$ the topology induce by $d$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ and $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$ with respect to the topology $\TT_d$.
2. $d(x_n,x_0) \to 0$ in $\R$.
3. For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n \in B_r(x_0) \, , \,\, \forall \, n \geq \N \,.
$$

:::

The proof is similar to the one of Proposition \ref{proposition-convergence-Rn}, and it is left as an exercise.






## Interior, closure and boundary


We now define interior, closure and boundary of a set $A$ contained 
in a topological space.


::: Definition
### Interior of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set.
The **interior** of $A$ is the set
$$
\interior{A} :=  \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT} } \, U \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

The definition of $\interior{A}$ is well-posed, since $\emptyset \subseteq A$ and $\emptyset \in \TT$. Therefore the union is taken over a non-empty family.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\interior{A}$ is the largest open set contained in $A$, that is:

1. $\interior{A}$ is open.
2. $\interior{A} \subseteq A$.
3. If $V \in \TT$ and $V \subseteq A$, then $V \subseteq \interior{A}$.
4. $A$ is open if and only if 
$$
A = \interior{A} \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

We have:

1. $\interior{A}$ is open, since it is union of open sets, see property (A2).
2. $\interior{A} \subseteq A$, since $\interior{A}$ is union of sets contained in $A$.

3. Suppose $V \in \TT$ and $V \subseteq A$. Therefore 
$$
V \subseteq   \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT} } \, U = \interior{A} \,.
$$

4. Suppose that $A$ is open. Then
$$
A \subseteq \bigcup_{ \substack{U \subseteq A \\ U \in \TT}  } \, U  = \interior{A}  \,.
$$
As we already know that $\interior{A} \subseteq A$, we conclude that $A = \interior{A}$.  
    Conversely, suppose that $A = \interior{A}$. Since $\interior{A}$ is open, then also $A$ is open.
:::




::: Definition
### Closure of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set.
The **closure** of $A$ is the set
$$
\closure{A} :=  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C^c \in \TT } } \, C \,,
$$
that is, $\closure{A}$ is the intersection of all closed sets containing 
$A$.

:::



::: Remark

The definition of $\closure{A}$ is well-posed, since $A \subseteq X$, and $X$ is closed. Therefore the intersection is taken over a non-empty family.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\closure{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$, that is:

1. $\closure{A}$ is closed.
2. $A \subseteq \closure{A}$.
3. If $V$ is closed $A \subseteq V$, then $\closure{A} \subseteq V$.
4. $A$ is closed if and only if 
$$
A = \closure{A} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We have:

1. $\closure{A}$ is closed, since it is intersection of closed sets, see property (C2).

2. $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, since $\closure{A}$ is intersection of sets which contain $A$.

3. Suppose $V$ is closed and $A \subseteq V$. Therefore 
$$
\closure{A} =  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C^c \in \TT} } \, C  \subseteq V \,.
$$

4. Suppose that $A$ is closed. Then
$$
\closure{A} =  \bigcap_{ \substack{A \subseteq C \\ C^c \in \TT} } \, C  \subseteq A \,,
$$
showing that $\closure{A} \subseteq A$. As we already know that $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, we conclude that $A = \closure{A}$.   
  Conversely, suppose that $A = \closure{A}$. Since $\closure{A}$ is closed, then also $A$ is closed.
:::





::: Definition
### Boundary of a set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. 
The **boundary** of $A$ is the set
$$
\partial A := \closure{A} \smallsetminus \interior{A} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. Then
$\partial A$ is closed.

:::


::: Proof 

We can write
$$
\partial A =  \closure{A} \smallsetminus \interior{A} = \closure{A} \cap (\interior{A})^c \,.
$$
Note that $\closure{A}$ is closed and $(\interior{A})^c$ is closed, 
since $\interior{A}$ is open. Then $\partial A$ is intersection
of two closed sets, and in hence closed by (C2).

:::




We can characterize $\closure{A}$ as the set of limit points of sequences in $A$.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. 
Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ and $x_0 \in X$ be such that $x_n \to x_0$. Then
$$
x_0 \in \closure{A} \,.
$$
In particular we have
$$
\closure{A} = \{  x \in X \st \exists \,\, \{ x_n \} \subseteq A \st x_n \to x   \} \,.
$${#eq-formula-closure}

:::


::: Proof


*Part 1.*
Suppose by contradiction $x_0 \notin \closure{A}$, so that
$$
x_0 \in (\closure{A})^c \,.
$$
Since $(\closure{A})^c$ is open and $x_n \to x_0$, there exists $N \in \N$
such that 
$$
x_n \in (\closure{A})^c \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
This is a contradiction, since we were assuming that $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$.

*Part 2.* We now show (@eq-formula-closure). Call $L$ the set of limit points
$$
L := \{  x \in X \st \exists \,\, \{ x_n \} \subseteq A \st x_n \to x   \} \,.
$$
We have to prove 2 inclusions:

- $L \subseteq \closure{A}$: This was already shown in Part 1.
- $\closure{A} \subseteq L$: Suppose by contradiction that $\closure{A} \not\subseteq L$. There exists a point $x_0 \in X$ such that
$$
x_0 \in L \,, \quad x_0 \notin \closure{A} \,.
$$
As $x_0$ in $L$, by definition there exists a sequence $\{x_n \} \subseteq A$ such that 
$x_n \to x_0$. Since $x_0 \notin \closure{A}$, then $x_0 \in (\closure{A})^c$. Recalling
that $(\closure{A})^c$ is open, by the convergence $x_n \to x_0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in (\closure{A})^c \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above yields a contradiction, since $\{x_n\} \subseteq A$ and $A \cap (\closure{A})^c = \emptyset$.
Therefore $\closure{A} \subseteq L$, concluding the proof.
:::




In metric spaces we can characterize the interior of a set in the following way.

::: Proposition


Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Denote by $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.
For $A \subseteq X$ we have
$$
\interior{A} = \{ x \in A \divider \exists \,\, r>0  \st B_r(x) \subseteq A   \} \,.
$$


:::


The proof is left as an exercise. 


::: Example

Consider $\R$ with the Euclidean topology and $A :=[0,1)$. We have that 
$$
\interior{A} = (0,1) \,, \quad \closure{A} = [0,1] \,, \quad \partial A = \{0,1\} \,.
$$
In particular 
$$
\interior{A}  \neq A \,, \quad \closure{A} \neq A \,,
$$
showing that $A$ is neither open, nor closed. 

> The proof of the above statements is left as an exercise.

## Density



::: Definition
### Density

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. We say that $A$ is **dense** in $X$ if 
$$
A \cap U \neq \emptyset \,, \quad \, \forall \,\, U \in \TT\,, \,\, U \neq \emptyset \,.
$$

:::



Density can be characterized in terms of closure.



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $A \subseteq X$ a set. They are equivalent:

1. $A$ is **dense** in $X$.
2. It holds
$$
\closure{A} = X \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let $A$ be dense in $X$. Suppose by contradiction that
$$
\closure{A} \neq X \,.
$$
This means $(\closure{A})^c \neq \emptyset$.
Note that $(\closure{A})^c$ is open, being $\closure{A}$ closed.
By density of $A$ in $X$ we have
$$
A \cap (\closure{A})^c \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Since $A \subseteq \closure{A}$, the above is a contradiction.


*Part 2.* Suppose that $\closure{A} = X$. Let $U \in \TT$ with $U \neq \emptyset$. By contradiction, assume that
$$
A \cap U = \emptyset \,.
$$
Therefore $A \subseteq U^c$. As $U^c$ is closed, we have
$$
\closure{A} \subseteq U^c\,, 
$$
because $\closure{A}$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$. 
Recalling that $\closure{A} = X$, we conclude that $U^c = X$. 
Therefore $U = \emptyset$, which is a contradiction.

:::




::: Example

Consider $\R$ with the Euclidean topology.

1. We have that the set of integers $\Z$ is closed in $\R$. Indeed,
$$
\Z^c = \bigcup_{ z \in \Z}  \, (z , z + 1 ) \,. 
$$
Since $(z,z+1)$ is open in $\R$, by (A2) we conclude that 
$\Z^c$ is open, so that $\Z$ is closed. Therefore 
$$
\closure{\Z} = \Z \,,
$$
showing that $\Z$ is not dense in $\R$.


2. The rational numbers $\Q$ are instead dense in $\R$, as proven in the
Analysis module. Therefore 
$$
\closure{\Q} = \R \,.
$$
The above implies that
$$
\interior{\Q} = \emptyset \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\interior{\Q} \neq \Q \,, \quad \closure{\Q} \neq \Q \,,
$$
showing that $\Q$ is neither open, nor closed. 



:::








## Hausdorff spaces



Hausdorff space are topological spaces in which points can be separated by
means of disjoint open sets.


::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is a Hausdorff space if for every two points $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$ there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$

:::



The main example of Hausdorff spaces are metrizable spaces.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-hausdorff-1}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then $(X, \TT_d)$ is a Hausdorff space.

:::


::: Proof

Let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Set 
$$
\e := \frac12 \, d(x,y) \,, 
$$
and define 
$$
U := B_{\e}(x)\,, \quad 
V := B_{\e}(y) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-metric-ball} we know that $U, V \in \TT_d$. Moreover $x \in U$, $y \in V$. We are left to show that 
$$
U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that $U \cap V = \emptyset$ and let $z \in U \cap V$. Therefore 
$$
d(x,z) < \e \,,  \quad d(y,z) < \e \,.
$$
By triangle inequality we have
$$
d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) +  d(y,z) < \e + \e = d(x,y) \,,
$$
where in the last inequality we used the definition of $\e$. This is 
a contradiction. Therefore $U \cap V = \emptyset$ and $(X,\TT_d)$ is Hausdorff.


:::


In general, every metrizable space is Hausdorff.


::: Definition
### Metrizable space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that the topology $\TT$ is metrizable if there
exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that
$$
\TT = \TT_d \,,
$$
with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.

:::


::: {.Corollary #corollary-hausdorff}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a metrizable space. Then $X$ is Hausforff.

:::


::: Proof

Since $(X,\TT)$ is metrizable, there exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that 
$$
\TT  = \TT_d \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-hausdorff-1} we know that $(X,\TT_d)$ is Hausdorff. Hence $(X,\TT)$ is Hausdorff.

:::



As a conseuqence of Corollary \ref{corollary-hausdorff} we have that
spaces which are not metrizable are not Hausdorff. Let us make 
a few examples.


::: Example
### Trivial topology is not Hausdorff

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space with $\TT$ trivial topology. Assume that $X$ has more than one element. Then $X$ is not Hausdorff.

> Indeed, let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Suppose by contradiction that $X$ is Hausdorff. Then there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that 
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
Recall that
$$
\TT = \{  \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Since $x \in U$ and $y \in V$, we deduce that $U$ and $V$ are non-empty. 
Since $U$ and $V$ are open, the only possibility is that 
$$
U = V = X \,.
$$
In this case we have
$$
U \cap V = X \cap X = X \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
leading to a contradiciton. Hence $X$ is not Hausdorff.


:::




::: Example
### Cofinite topology on $\R$

Consider the following family $\TT$ of subsets of $\R$
$$
\TT := \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \}\,. 
$$
Then $(\R,\TT)$ is a topological space which is not Hausdorff. The topology $\TT$ is called the **cofinite topology**.

:::









In Hausdorff spaces the limit of a sequence is unique.


::: Proposition
### Uniqueness of limit in Hausdorff spaces

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a Hausdorff space. If a sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ converges, then the limit is unique.

:::


::: Proof

Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ be a convergent sequence. Suppose by contradiction that 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,, \quad x_n \to y_0
$$
in $X$, for some $x_0,y_0 \in X$ with $x_0 \neq y_0$. Since $X$ is Hausdorff, there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that 
$$
x_0 \in U \,, \quad y_0 \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
As $x_n \to x_0$ and $U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$, there exists
$N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1  \,.
$$
Similarly, since $x_n \to y_0$ and $V \in \TT$ with $y_0 \in U$, there exists
$N_2 \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2  \,.
$$
Take $N:=\max\{N_1,N_2\}$. Then 
$$
x_n \in U \cap V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N  \,.
$$
Since $U \cap V = \emptyset$, the above is a contradiction. Therefore the limit of $x_n$ is unique.

## Continuity

We extend the notion of continuity to topological spaces. To this end, 
we need the concept of pre-image of a set under a function.

::: Definition
### Images and Pre-images

Let $X, Y$ be sets and $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. 

- Let $U \subseteq X$. The image of $U$ under $f$ is the subset of $Y$ defined by
$$
f (U) := \{ y \in Y \divider \exists \, x \in X \st y = f(x) \} = \{ f(x) \divider x \in X \} \,.
$$

- Let $V \subseteq Y$. The pre-image of $V$ under $f$ is the subset of $X$ defined by
$$
f^{-1} (V) := \{ x \in X \divider f(x) \in V \} \,.
$$

:::


::: Warning

The notation $f^{-1}(V)$ does not mean that we are inverting $f$. In fact, the pre-image is defined for all functions.

:::


Let us gather useful properties of images and pre-images.


::: Proposition

Let $X,Y$ be sets and $f \colon X \to Y$. We denote with the letter $A$ sets in $X$ and with the letter $B$ sets in $Y$. We have

- $A \subseteq f^{-1}(f(A))$
- $A = f^{-1}(f(A))$ if $f$ is injective
- $f(f^{-1}(B)) \subseteq B$
- $f(f^{-1}(B)) = B$ if $f$ is surjective
- If $A_1 \subseteq A_2$ then $f(A_1) \subseteq f(A_2)$
- If $B_1 \subseteq B_2$ then $f^{-1}(B_1) \subseteq f^{-1}(B_2)$
- If $A_i \subseteq X$ for $i \in I$ we have
\begin{gather*}
f \left(  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \right)  = \bigcup_{i \in I} f(A_i) \\
f \left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} A_i \right)  \subseteq \bigcap_{i \in I} f(A_i) 
\end{gather*}
- If $B_i \subseteq Y$ for $i \in I$ we have
\begin{gather*}
f^{-1} \left(  \bigcup_{i \in I} B_i \right)  = \bigcup_{i \in I} f^{-1}(B_i) \\
f^{-1} \left(  \bigcap_{i \in I} B_i \right)  = \bigcap_{i \in I} f^{-1}(B_i) 
\end{gather*}

Suppose $Z$ is another set and $g \colon Y \to Z$. Let $C \subseteq Z$. Then
\begin{align*}
& (g \circ f)(A)  = g(f(A)) \\
& (g \circ f)^{-1}(C)  = f^{-1}(g^{-1}(C)) 
\end{align*}

:::

It is a good exercise to try and prove a few of the above properties.
We omit the proof. We can now define continuous functions between topological spaces.

::: Definition
### Continuous function

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. 

- Let $x_0 \in X$. We say that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ if it holds:
$$
\forall \, V \in \TT_Y \st f(x_0) \in V \,, \,\, \exists \, U \in \TT_X \st x_0 \in U \,, \,\, f(U) \subseteq V \,.
$$

- We say that $f$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_X)$ to $(Y,\TT_Y)$ if $f$ is continuous at each point $x_0 \in X$.

:::



The following proposition presents a useful characterization of continuous functions in terms of pre-images. 


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-continuity-characterization}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a function. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_X)$ to $(Y,\TT_Y)$.
2. It holds:
$$
f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X  \,, \quad \forall \, V \in \TT_Y \,. 
$$

:::

::: Important

In other words, a function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if the pre-image of open sets in $Y$ are open sets in $X$. 

:::

The proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-continuity-characterization} is simple, but very tedious. We choose to skip it.



::: Example

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. Define the identity map

Let us compare our new definition of contiuity with the classical notion of continuity in $\R^n$. Let us recall the definition of continuous function in $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Continuity in the classical sense

Let $f \colon \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, \delta >0 \st \|f(\xx) - f(\xx_0)\|< \e \,\, \mbox{ if } \,\, \| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \,.   
$$

:::


::: Proposition

Let $f \colon  \R^n \to \R^m$ and suppose $\R^n,\R^m$ are 
equipped with the Euclidean topology. Let $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the topological sense.
2. $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the classical sense.

:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* Suppose that $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the topological sense. Let $\e>0$ and consider the set 
$$
V := B_{\e}(f(\xx_0))\,.
$$
We have that $V \subset \R^m$ is open and $f(\xx_0) \in V$. As $f$ is 
continuous in the topological sense, there exists $U \subset \R^n$ open with $\xx_0 \in U$ and such that 
$$
f(U) \subset V = B_{\e}(f(\xx_0)) \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-3}
Since $U$ is open and $\xx_0 \in U$, there exists $\delta>0$ such that
$$
B_{\delta}(\xx_0) \subset U \,.
$$
By the above inclusion and (@eq-proof-continuity-3) we conclude that
$$
f(B_{\delta}(\xx_0)) \subset f(U) \subset V = B_{\e}(f(\xx_0)) \,.
$$
This is equivalent to 
$$
\xx \in B_{\delta}(\xx_0) \quad \implies  \quad f(\xx) \in B_{\e}(f(\xx_0))\,,
$$
which reads
$$
\| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad
\| f(\xx) - f(\xx_0) \| < \e \,.
$$
Therefore $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the classical sense.




*Part 2.* Suppose $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ in the classical sense. 
Let $V \subset \R^m$ be open and such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$. Since $V$
is open, there exists $\e>0$ such that 
$$
B_{\e} (f(\xx_0)) \subset V \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-2}
Since $f$ is continous in the classical sense, there exists $\delta>0$ such that 
$$
  \| \xx - \xx_0 \| < \delta \quad \implies \|f(\xx) - f(\xx_0)\|< \e  \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to
$$
\xx \in B_{\delta}(\xx_0)  \quad \implies \quad f(\xx) \in B_{\e} (f (\xx_0))  \,.
$${#eq-proof-continuity-1}
Set 
$$
U:= B_{\delta}(\xx_0)
$$
and note that $U$ is open in $\R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in U$. By definition 
of image of a set, (@eq-proof-continuity-1) reads
$$
f(U) = f( B_{\delta}(\xx_0))   \subseteq  B_{\e} (f(\xx_0)) \,.
$$
Recalling (@eq-proof-continuity-2) we conclude that 
$$
f(U) \subset V \,.
$$
In summary, we have shown that given $V \subset \R^m$ open and such that $f(\xx_0) \in V$, there exists $U$ open in $\R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U$ and $f(U) \subset V$. Therefore $f$ is continuous at $\xx_0$ in the 
topological sense.

A similar proof yields the characterization of continuity in metric
spaces. The proof is left as an exercise. 


::: Proposition

Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. Denote by $\TT_X$ and $\TT_Y$ the topologies induced by the metrics. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ and $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ in the topological sense.
2. It holds:
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, \delta >0 \st \, d_Y(f(x),f(x_0))<\e \,\, 
\mbox{ if } \,\, d_X(x , x_0) < \delta \,.
$$

:::



Let us examine continuity in the cases of the trivial and discrete topologies.


::: Example
Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be a topological space. Suppose that 
$\TT_Y$ is the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT_Y = \{ \emptyset, Y \} \,.
$$
Then every function $f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous. 


> Indeed, we know that $f$ is continuous if and only if it holds:
> $$
> f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X \,, \quad \forall \,\, V \in \TT_Y \,.
> $$
> We have two cases:
>
>  - $V=\emptyset$: Then 
>  $$
>  f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \in \TT_X \,.
>  $$
>  - $V=Y$: Then 
>  $$
>  f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(Y) = X \in \TT_X \,.
>  $$
>
> Therefore $f$ is continuous.

:::



::: Example
Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Suppose that 
$\TT_Y$ is the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT_Y = \{ V \st V \subseteq Y \} \,.
$$
Let $f \colon X \to Y$. They are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous from $X$ to $Y$.
2. $f^{-1}(\{y\}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$.  


> Indeed, suppose that $f$ is continuous. Then
> $$

> Therefore 
> $$
> f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{y \in V}\, \{ y \} \right) = \bigcup_{y \in V} \, f^{-1}( \{y \} ) \,.
> $$
> As $f^{-1}( \{y \}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$, by property (A2) we conclude that $f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X$. Therefore $f$ is continuous.

In a topological space, continuity preserves limits
of sequences. 



::: {.Proposition #proposition-continuity-sequential}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Let 
$f \colon X \to Y$ be continuous. Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$
and $x_0 \in X$. We have
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in }\, X \quad \implies \quad 
f(x_n) \to f(x_0) \,\, \mbox{ in }\, Y\,.
$$


:::



::: Proof

Let $V \in \TT_Y$ be such that $f(x_0) \in V$. Since $f$ is continuous there exists $U \in \TT_X$ with $x_0 \in U$ such that 
$$
f(U) \subset V \,.
$$
Since $U \in \TT_X$ and $x_n \to x_0$ in $X$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
f(x_n) \in f(U) \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Seeing that $f(U) \subset V$, we conclude 
$$
f(x_n) \in V \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
showing that $f(x_n) \to f(x_0)$ in $Y$.

:::


::: Warning

The converse implication of Proposition \ref{proposition-continuity-sequential} is false. That is, even if it holds
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,\, \mbox{ in }\, X \quad \implies \quad 
f(x_n) \to f(x_0) \,\, \mbox{ in }\, Y\,.
$$
for all sequences $\{x_n\} \subset X$, the function $f$ might **not** be continuous. For this to hold, it is necessary for the topologies on
$X$ and $Y$ to be metrizable.

Let us make an observation on continuity of compositions.


:::  Proposition

Let $(X,\TT_X), (Y,\TT_Y), (Z,\TT_Z)$ be topological spaces. Let 
$$
f \colon X \to Y \,, \quad g \colon Y \to Z \,,
$$
be given functions. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous, then 
$$
(g \circ f) \colon X \to Z 
$$
is continuous.
:::

::: Proof

Let $C \in \TT_Z$. As $g$ is continuous, we have that 
$$
g^{-1}(C) \in \TT_Y \,.
$$ 
Since $f$ is continuous, we also have
$$
f^{-1} ( g^{-1}(C) ) \in \TT_X \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
(g \circ f)^{-1} ( C ) = f^{-1} ( g^{-1}(C) ) \in \TT_X \,,
$$
so that $g \circ f$ is continuous.
:::


We conclude the section by introducing homeomorphisms.

::: Definition
### Homeomoprhim

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological space. A function $f \colon X \to Y$ is called an **homeomorphism** if they hold:

1. $f$ is continuous.
2. There exists $g \colon Y \to X$ continuous such that 
$$
g \circ f = {\id}_{X} \,, \quad f \circ g = {\id}_{Y}  \,.
$$

:::


The above is saying that $f$ is a homeomorphism if it is continuous and has continuous inverse. Homeomorphisms are the way we say that two topological spaces look the same.




## Subspace topology


Any subset $Y$ in a topological space $X$ inherits naturally a topological structure. Such structure is called **subspace topology**.


::: Definition
### Subspace topology   {#definition-subspace-topology}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $Y \subseteq X$ a subset. Define the family of sets
$$
\SSS := \{ A \subset Y \divider \exists \,\, U \in \TT \st A = U \cap Y   \} \,.
$$
The family $\SSS$ is called subspace topology on $Y$ induced by the inclusion $Y \subset X$.

:::


::: Proof
### Well-posedness of Definition \ref{definition-subspace-topology}

We have to show that $(Y,\SSS)$ is a topological space:

- (A1) $\emptyset \in \SSS$ since
$$
\emptyset = \emptyset \cap Y
$$
and $\emptyset \in \TT$. Similarly we have $Y \in \SSS$, since
$$
Y = X \cap Y \,,
$$
and $X \in \TT$.

- (A2) Let $A_i \in \SSS$ for $i \in I$. By definition there exist $U_i \in \TT$ such that 
$$
A_i =  U_i \cap Y \,, \quad \forall \, i \in I \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} \, A_i = 
\bigcup_{i \in I} (U_i \cap Y ) =
\left(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \right) \cap Y  \,.
$$
The above proves that $\cup_{i \in I} \, A_i \in \SSS$, since 
$\cup_{i \in I} \, U_i \in \TT$.

- (A3) Let $A_1, A_2 \in \SSS$. By definition there exist $U_1,U_2 \in \TT$ such that 
$$
A_1 =  U_1 \cap Y \,, \quad
A_2 =  U_2 \cap Y
$$
Therefore 
$$
A_1 \cap A_2  = (  U_1 \cap Y ) \cap (U_2 \cap Y) = (U_1 \cap U_2) \cap Y
$$
The above proves that $A_1 \cap A_2  \in \SSS$, since 
$U_1 \cap U_2 \in \TT$.
:::



If the set $Y$ is open, then sets are open in the subspace topology if
and only if they are open in $X$.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $Y \in \TT$ a subset. Let
$A \subset Y$. Then
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \iff \quad A \in \TT \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof
Suppose $A \in \SSS$. Then there exists $U \in \TT$ such that
$$
A = U \cap Y \,. 
$$
Since $U, Y \in \TT$, by property (A3) of topologies it follows 
that 
$$
A = U \cap Y  \in \TT \,. 
$$

Conversely, assume that $A \in \TT$. Then
$$
A = A \cap Y \,,
$$
showing that $A \in \SSS$.
:::




::: Warning

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space, $A \subset Y \subset X$. In general we could have
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \mbox{and} \quad A \notin \TT
$$

> For example consider $X=\R$ with $\TT$ the euclidean topology. Consider the subset $Y = [0,2)$ and equip $Y$ with the subspace topology $\SSS$. Let $A = [0,1)$. Then $A \notin \TT$ but $A \in \SSS$, since 
$$
A =  (-1,1)  \cap Y
$$
and $(-1,1) \in \TT$.

:::




::: Example

Let $X=\R$ be equipped with $\TT$ the euclidean topology. Let 
$\SSS$ be the subspace topology on $\Z$. Then $\SSS$ coincides with
the discrete topology.

> *Proof.* The set $\{z\}$ is open in $\SSS$ for all $z \in \Z$. Indeed, 
$$
\{z\} = \left(  z-1 , z + 1   \right)   \cap \Z \,
$$
and $(z - 1, z + 1) \in \TT$. Thus $\{z\} \in \SSS$. Let now $A \subseteq \Z$. Then
$$
A = \bigcup_{z \in A} \, \{ z \} \,,
$$
and therefore $A \in \SSS$ by (A2). This proves that
$$
\SSS = \{ A \st A \subseteq \Z \} \,,
$$
that is, $\SSS$ is the discrete topology on $\Z$.
