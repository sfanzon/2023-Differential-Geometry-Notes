# Surfaces


Curves are 1D objects in $\R^3$, parametrized via functions $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$. 
There is only one available direction in which to move on a curve:

- $t \mapsto \g(t)$ moves forward on the curve 
- $t \mapsto \g(-t)$ moves backward on the curve

Surfaces are 2D objects in $\R^3$. There are two directions in which one can move on a surface.

::: Question

How to dercribe a surface mathematically?

:::


A curve $\Gamma \subseteq \R^3$ can be described with one function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$. The idea is that $\Gamma$ looks locally like $\R$.


![A curve $\Gamma$ can be described by a function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$.](/images/curves_example_2.png){width=60%}


A surface $\SSS$ cannot be described, in general, with just one function $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$, with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open set. The idea is that, to describe $\SSS$, one needs to piece together many local **charts** $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open. Such charts have to cover the whole surface $\SSS$, e.g.
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$

## Preliminaries


Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we need to establish
some basic notation and terminology regarding the topology of $\R^n$ and smooth maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.



### Topology of $\R^n$


The Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ is denoted by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 }\,, \quad \xx = (x_1 , \ldots, x_n) \in \R^n \,.
$$
The Euclidean norm induces the distance
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \| \xx - \yy \| =   \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 } \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Euclidean Topology 

The pair $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space. The topology induced by the metric $d$ is called the Euclidean topology, denoted by $\TT$. In this chapter we will always assume that $\R^n$ is equipped with the Euclidean topology $\TT$.

:::


::: Definition 
### Open Sets

A set $U \subseteq \R^n$ is open if for all $\xx \in U$ there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx) \subseteq U$, where
$$
B_{\e}(\xx) := \{  \yy \in \R^n \divider \| \xx - \yy  \| < \e   \}
$$
is the open ball of radius $\e>0$ and centered at $\xx$. In this case we denote $U \in \TT$, with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology in $\R^n$.

:::



::: Definition 
### Closed Sets 

A set $V \subseteq \R^n$ is closed if $V^c := \R^n \smallsetminus U$ is open. 

:::




::: Example

- The $n$-dimensional unit sphere
$$
\sphere^n = \{ \xx \in \R^{n+1} \divider \| x \| = 1 \}
$$
is not open in $\R^{n+1}$, since for any $\xx \in \sphere^n$ we have
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq \sphere^{n} \,. 
$$

- The $n$-dimensional unit cube 
$$
C := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| <1  \}
$$
is open in $\R^n$, since one can always find $\e>0$ small enough so that
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq C \,. 
$$

- The set 
$$
V := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \geq 1  \}
$$
is closed, since $V^c = C$ is the unit cube, which is open.

:::



::: Definition 
### Subspace Topology

Given a subset $A \subseteq \R^n$ the subspace topology on $A$ is the family of sets
$$
\TT_A := \{  U \subseteq A \divider \exists \,\, W \in \TT \st U = A \cap W  \} \,.
$$
If $U \in \TT_A$ we say that $U$ is open in $A$.

:::





### Smooth functions


We recall some basic facts about smooth functions from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$. For a vector valued function $f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ we denote its components by 
$$
f = (f_1,\ldots,f_m) \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Continuous Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx \in U$ if $\forall \, \e>0$, \, $\exists \, \delta > 0$ such that 
$$
\|  \xx - \yy  \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad 
\| f(\xx) - f (\yy) \| < \e \,.
$$
We say that $f$ is continuous in $U$ if it is continuous for all $\xx \in U$.
:::


::: Remark

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$, with $U,V$ open. We have that $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $U$, for all $A$ open in $V$.

:::


::: Definition
### Homeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$ with $U,V$ open. We say that $f$ is a homeomorphism if $f$ is continuous and there exists inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$ continuous.

:::



::: Definition
### Differentiable Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $\xx \in U$ if there exists a linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ such that
$$
\lim_{\e \to 0} \   \frac{ f(\xx + \e \pmb{h} )  - f(\xx) - \e \, df_{\xx}(\pmb{h}) }{ \e } = 0 \,,
$$
for all $\pmb{h} \in \R^n$, where the limit is taken in $\R^m$. The map $df_{\xx}$ is called the **differential** of $f$ at $\xx$. 

:::


We denote by $\{\ee_i\}_{i=1}^n$ the standard basis of $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Partial Derivative

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open be differentiable. The partial derivative of $f$ at $\xx \in U$ in direction $\ee_i$ is given by
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} := \lim_{\e \to 0}  \frac{ f( \xx + \e \ee_i ) - f(\xx) }{ \e } \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition
### Jacobian Matrix

The linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ can be represented in matrix form, with respect to the Euclidean basis, by the Jacobian matrix
$$
Jf(x):= \left( \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} \right)_{i,j}  \in \R^{m \times n} \,.
$$
If $m=n$ then $Jf \in \R^{n \times n}$ is a square matrix and we can compute its determinant, denoted by
$$
\det Jf \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition
### Multi-index notation

For a multi-index
$$
\alpha := (\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n) \in \N^n
$$
we denote by 
$$
|\alpha|:= \sum_{i=1}^n   |\alpha_i|
$$
the length of the multi-index. 

:::




::: Definition
### Smooth Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is smooth if the derivatives 
$$
\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} f}{d\xx^\alpha} :=  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{ \partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{ \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} \, f
$$
exist for each multi-index $\alpha \in \N^n$. Note that in this case all the derivatives of $f$ are automatically continuous.

:::




::: Notation
### Gradient and partial derivatives

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ be smooth. We denote the partial derivatives by 
$$
\partial_{x_i} f := \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \,, \quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j} f := \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \,,
\quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j x_k} f := \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k} \,.
$$

For $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ smooth we denote the **gradient** by
$$
\nabla f (\xx) = \left(  f_{x_1}(\xx) , \ldots ,  f_{x_n}(\xx) \right) \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

The functions $f \colon \R^2 \to \R$ and $g \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ defined by
$$
f(x,y) := \cos(x)y \,, \quad 
g(x,y) := (x^2,y^2,x-y)
$$
are both smooth.

:::



::: Definition
### Diffeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \to V$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $V \subseteq \R^n$ open. We say that $f$ is a **diffeomorphism** between $U$ and $V$ if $f$ is smooth and there exists 
smooth inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$.

:::



We recall, without proof, the Inverse Function Theorem. Please note that in the statement the function $f$ is defined from $\R^n$ into $\R^n$.



::: Theorem
### Inverse Function Theorem

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a smooth function and
$$
\det J f(\xx_0) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for some $\xx_0 \in U$. Then there exist open sets $U_0 , V \subseteq \R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U_0$, $f(\xx_0) \in V$ and $f \colon U_0 \to V$ is a diffeomorphism.


:::


::: Warning 

Even if 
$$
\det J f(\xx) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for all $\xx \in U$, it is not guaranteed that $f$ is a diffeomorphism between $U$ and $f(U)$.

:::


Non-vanishing Jacobian determinant is a necessary condition for being a diffeomorphism.



::: Proposition

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a diffeomorphism on $U$. Then 
$$
\det Jf (\xx) \neq 0 \,, \quad   \forall \, \xx \in \R^n \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

Define $f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2$ by
$$
f(x,y) := (\cos(x) \sin(y), \sin(x) \sin(y)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
J f (x,y) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 - \sin(x) \sin(y)  &   \cos(x) \cos(y) \\
 \cos(x) \sin(y)    &   \sin(x) \cos(y)
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\det Jf(x,y) & = - \sin^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) - \cos^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) \\
             & = - \sin(y) \cos(y) \\
             & = - \frac{1}{2} \sin(2y) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
\det Jf(x,y) \neq 0 \quad \iff \quad 
y \neq \frac{n \pi}{2} \,, \,\, n \in \N \,.
$$
Hence $f$ is a diffeomorphism away from the lines
$$
L_n := \left\{ \left(x, \frac{n \pi}{2} \right) \divider x \in \R \right\} \,.
$$

## Definition of Surface


We can finally give the definition of surface in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Surface

Let $\SSS \subseteq \R^3$ be a connected set. We say that $\SSS$ is a **surface** if for every point $\pp \in \SSS$ there exist an open set  $U \subseteq \R^2$ and a smooth map
$$
\sss \colon U \to  \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,
$$
such that 

- $\pp \in \sss(U)$
- $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$
- $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $U$ and $\sss(U)$


Further:

- The homeomorphism $\sss$ is called a **surface chart** at $\pp$. 
- For each $i \in I$ suppose to have a surface chart
$$
\sss_i  \colon U_i \to \sss(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
We say that the family 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I}
$$ 
is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i \in I} \sss_i(U_i)  \,.
$$


:::




::: Remark

- A surface chart $\sss$ is a map from $\R^2$ into $\R^3$.


- Given a chart $\sss \colon U \to \sss(U)$, the set $U$ is open in $\R^2$ while $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$ with the subspace topology. This means that there exists $W \subseteq \R^3$ open such that
$$
\sss(U) = W \cap \SSS \,.
$$

- The omeomorphism condition is saying that $\sss(U) \subseteq \SSS$ looks locally (around $\pp$) like an open set $U \subseteq \R^2$.

:::

::: Notation

- Points in $U$ will be denoted with the pair $(u,v)$.

- Partial derivatives of a chart $\sss = \sss (u,v)$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss_u := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial u} \,, \quad 
\sss_v := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial v} \,.
$$
Similar notations are adopted for higher order derivatives, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
\sss_{uu} & := \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial u^2} \,, 
& \sss_{uv} & :=  \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial u \partial v} \,, \\
\sss_{vu} & := \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial v  \partial u  } \,,  
& \sss_{vv} & :=  \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial v^2 } \,, \\
\end{align*}

- Components of $\sss$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss = (\sigma^1, \sigma^2, \sigma^3) \,.
$$

:::




::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Planes in $\R^3$ are surfaces with atlas containing one chart. Namely, a plane
$\pi \subseteq \R^3$ is described by
$$
\pi  = \{  \xx  \in \R^3 \divider \xx \cdot \ww = \lambda \} \,.
$$
Let

- $\pp,\pmb{q} \in \R^3$ be ortoghonal to each other and to $\ww$.
- $\pmb{a} \in \pi$ be any point in the plane.


If $\xx \in \pi$ then $\xx-\pmb{a}$ is parallel to the plane and $\pi$ can be
equivalently represented as
$$
\pi = \{ \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} \,.
$$
Define the map
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \pi \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \,.
$$
We have:

- $\sss$ is smooth.
- $\R^2$ is obviously open.
- $\sss(\R^2)$ is open in $\pi$, since $\sss(\R^2) = \pi$.
- The inverse of $\sss$ is 
$$
\sss^{-1} \colon \pi \to \R^2 \,, \quad 
\sss^{-1} (\xx) = ( (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pp , (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pmb{q}  ) \,.
$$
- As $\sss^{-1}$ is continuous, then $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $\R^2$ and $\pi$. 


Therefore $\sss$ is a chart for $\pi$. Since
$$
\sss(\R^2) = \pi \,,
$$
we have that $\{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\pi$, and hence $\pi$ is a surface.

### Unit cylinder

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
$\SSS$ is a surface with an atlas consisting of two charts:
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss_i(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
for $i=1,2$, where
$$
U_1 := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, \quad 
U_2 := \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,.
$$

$$
\SSS = \sss_1(U_1) \cup \sss_2(U_2) \,.

::: Important


Consider again the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Define the map 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss (u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
where
$$
U:= [ 0, 2 \pi ] \times \R \,.
$$
Clearly we have 
$$
\sss(U) = \SSS \,.
$$
However $\{\sss\}$ is not an atlas for $\SSS$, since $\sss$ is not a chart. This is because $\sss$ is not invertible, as for example
$$
\sss(0,0) = \sss(2\pi,0) \,. 
$$
Therefore $\sss$ cannot be an omeomorphism between $U$ and $\SSS$.

$$
We have that $\Gamma_f$ is a surface with atlas given by
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss \}
$$
where $\sss \colon U \to \Gamma_f$ is
$$
\sss(u,v):=(u,v,f(u,v)) \,.

Let us conclude the section with an example of a set which is not 
a surface.



::: Example
### Circular cone

Consider the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} \,.
$$
Then $\SSS$ is not a surface. This is essentially consequence of
the fact that
$$
\SSS \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is a disconnected set.


To see that $\SSS$ is not a surface, suppose there exists an 
atlas $\{\sss_i\}$ of $\SSS$
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \sss_i(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
In particular there exists a chart $\sss_{i_0}$ such that 
$$
\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(U_{i_0}) \,.
$$
Let $\xx_0 \in U_{i_0}$ be the point such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(\xx_0) = \zero \,.
$$
Consider the ball $B_{\e}(\xx_0)$ for any $\e > 0$. Since $\sss_{i_0}$ is a homeomorphism, we deduce that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))
$$
is open in $\SSS$. Hence there exists an open set $W$ in $\R^3$ such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) = \SSS \cap W \,.
$$
As $\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ and $W$ is open in $\R^3$, it follows that
$W$ contains points of both $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, with
$$
\SSS^- := \SSS \cap \{ z < 0 \}   \,, \quad
\SSS^+ := \SSS \cap \{ z > 0 \}   \,.
$$

>This is because $W$ contains a ball of suitable radius $\delta>0$ and centered at $\zero$.

Hence $\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ contains points of $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, implying that 
$$
V := \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is disconnected, with disconnection given by
$$
V = ( V \cap \SSS^- ) \cup (V \cap \SSS^+) \,.
$$
However $V$ is homeomorphic to 
$$
B_{\e} (\xx_0) \smallsetminus \{ \xx_0 \} \,,
$$
which is instead connected. Contradiction. Hence $\SSS$ is not a surface.

## Regular Surfaces


We have defined a regular curve to be a map $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ such that
$$
\norm{\g(t)} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
This allowed us to define tangent vectors and, eventually, Frenet frame.

We want to do something similar for surfaces: We look for a condition that eventually will allow us to define tangent planes. This is why we introduce **regular charts** and **regular surfaces**.



::: Definition
### Regular Chart

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open. A map
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v)  \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called a **regular chart** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
:::


The following gives more insight into the regularity condition.


::: Proposition

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and consider a map
$$
\sss  \colon U \to \R^3 \,.
$$
They are equivalent:

1. $\sss$ is a regular chart.
2. The differential $d\sss_{\xx} \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is injective for all $\xx \in U$.
3. The Jacobian matrix
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
has rank $2$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
4. It holds
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad  \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$


:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 4.* 

By the properties of vector product, we have that
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad \, \forall (u,v) \in U 
$$
if and only if $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent for all $(u,v) \in U$.


*Part 2. Equivalence of Point 2 and Point 3.* 

The differential $d\sss_{\xx} \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is represented in matrix form by the Jacobian
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
By standard linear algebra results, $J\sss$ has rank 2 if and only if $d\sss$ is injective. 

*Part 3. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 3.*

A $3 \times 2$ matrix has rank 2 if and only if its columns are linearly independent. Since the columns of $J\sss$ are $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$, we 
conclude that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent.

We are now ready to define regular surfaces.


::: Definition
### Regular surface

Let $\SSS$ be a surface. Let 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i \in I} \,,
$$
be an atlas for $\SSS$. We say that:

- $\mathcal{A}$ is a **regular atlas** if 
the map $\sss_i$ is a regular chart for all $i \in I$. 
- $\SSS$ is a **regular surface** if there exists a regular atlas for $\SSS$.

:::







::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Let $\pmb{a}, \pp, \pmb{q} \in \R^3$, with $\pp$ and $\pmb{q}$ orthogonal. We have shown that the plane
$$
\pi = \{ \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} 
$$
is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$, where
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \pi \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \,.
$$
Then $\pi$ is a regular surface, because $\sss$ is a regular chart. To see this, compute
$$
\sss_u = \pp  \,, \quad \sss_v = \pmb{q} \,.
$$
Since $\pp$ and $\pmb{q}$ are orthogonal, then they are linearly independent. Thus $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, and $\sss$ is a regular chart.

::: Example
### Unit cylinder {#example-unit-cylinder}

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
We have seen that $\SSS$ is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_1,\sss_2\}$ where we define
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 & := \sss |_{U_1} \,,   & \sss_2 & := \sss |_{U_2} \,, \\
U_1 & := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, 
& U_2 & := \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,.
\end{align*}
We have that $\SSS$ is a regular surface, since the atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is regular. Indeed:
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u),0) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,0,1) \,,
$$
and therefore
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (\cos (u), \sin(u), 0)  \,, \quad \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} = 1 \,.
$$
This implies
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Therefore
$\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$ are regular charts, being restrictions of $\sss$.

::: Example
### Graph of a function

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and $f \colon U \to \R$ be smooth. The graph of $f$ is the set
$$
\Gamma_f := \{ (u,v,f(u,v)) \divider (u,v) \in U  \}  \,.
$$
We have seen that $\Gamma_f$ is surface with atlas given by
$\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss \}$, where $\sss \colon U \to \Gamma_f$ is
$$
\sss(u,v):=(u,v,f(u,v)) \,.
$$
We have that $\Gamma_f$ is regular, since $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas.
Indeed, 
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,f_u) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,1,f_v) \,,
$$
and so
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (-f_u, - f_v, 1 ) \neq \zero \,,
$$
since the last component never vanishes. Therefore $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are
linearly independent and $\sss$ is a regular chart.

### Unit sphere

Consider the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
We have that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface, with regular atlas
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i=1}^6 \,,
$$
defined as follows: Let 
$$
U:= \{ (u,v) \in \R^2 \colon u^2 + v^2 < 1  \}
$$
be the unit open ball in $\R^2$ and define $\sss_i \colon U \to \R^3$ by
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_2 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_3 (u,v) & = \left(u,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2},v  \right) \\
\sss_4 (u,v) & = \left(u, -\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, v  \right) \\
\sss_5 (u,v) & = \left(\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2} , u ,v \right) \\
\sss_6 (u,v) & = \left(-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, u,v,  \right) \\

::: Remark 
### Spherical coordinates

The equivalent of polar coordinates in dimension $3$ are spherical coordinates. A point $(x,y,z) \in \R^3 \smallsetminus \{\zero\}$ can
be represented in spherical coordinates by
\begin{align*}
x & = \rho \cos (\theta)  \cos(\phi)  \\
y & = \rho \cos (\theta)  \sin(\phi) \\
z & = \rho \sin (\theta) 
\end{align*}
where 
$$
\rho:=\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 } \,, \quad \f \in [0,2\pi] \,, \quad \theta \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \,,
$$
with the angles $\f$ and $\theta$ as in Figure @fig-spherical-coordinates.

> It is clear that $z = \rho \sin(\theta)$, by basic trigonometry. To compute $x$ and $y$, we note
that the segment joining $\zero$ to $\pp$ has length 
$$
L = \rho \cos \theta \,.
$$
Therefore we get
\begin{align*}
x & = L \cos (\phi) = \rho \cos (\theta)  \cos(\phi) \\
y & = L \sin (\phi) = \rho \cos (\theta)  \sin(\phi) 
\end{align*}
concluding.

::: Example
### Unit sphere in spherical coordinates

Consider again the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
We want to give an alternative atlas for $\sphere^2$ based on spherical coordinates. To this end, define
$$
U := \left\{ (\theta,\phi)  \in \R^2 \divider -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \,, \,\, 
0< \phi < 2 \pi    \right\}
$$
and $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\sss( \theta , \phi ) :=  ( \cos(\theta) \cos(\phi), \cos(\theta) \sin(\phi), \sin (\theta)  ) \,.
$$
We have:

- $\sss$ is smooth.

- $U$ is open in $\R^2$.

- Moreover
$$
\sss (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,0,z) \in \R^3 \divider x \geq 0  \} \,,
$$
as seen also in the left picture in @fig-chart-sphere. 

- The set $\sss(U)$ is evidently open in $\sphere^2$. 

- It is easy to check that $\sss$ is invertible, with continuous inverse. 

- Thus $\sss$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ into $\sss(U)$.

Let us check that $\sss$ is a regular chart:
\begin{align*}
\sss_{\theta} & = (-\sin(\theta) \cos(\phi), -\sin(\theta) \sin(\phi), \cos(\theta) ) \\
 \sss_{\phi} & = ( - \cos(\theta) \sin(\phi), \cos(\theta) \cos(\phi), 0 )  \,.
\end{align*} 
Therefore 
$$
\sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} = 
( - \cos^2(\theta) \cos(\phi), - \cos^2(\theta) \sin(\phi), - \sin(\theta) \cos ( \theta ) ) \,,
$$
from which
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} } = |\cos (\theta)| \, .
$$
Since $(\theta,\phi)\in U$, we have $\theta \in ( -\pi/2, \pi/2 )$, and so
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} } = |\cos (\theta)| \neq 0 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_{\theta}$ and $\sss_{\phi}$ are linearly independent, and
$\sss$ is regular.

Since $\sss(U) \neq \sphere^2$, the chart $\sss$ does not form an atlas. We need a second chart. An option is to define $\widetilde{\sss} \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\widetilde{\sss} := ( - \cos(\theta) \cos (\phi), -\sin(\theta) , - \cos (\theta) \sin(\phi)) \,.
$$
Notice that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is obtained by rotating $\sss$ by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis and by $\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis, as seen in the right picture in @fig-chart-sphere. It is an exercise to check that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a regular chart. 

Since we have
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,y,0) \in \R^3 \divider x \leq 0  \} \,,
$$
it is immediate to see that
$$
\sphere^2 = \sss(U) \cup \widetilde{\sss}(U) \,.
$$
Hence
$$
\mathcal{A} := \{   \sss , \widetilde{\sss} \} 
$$
is a regular atlas for $\sphere^2$.

Let us make an example of a non-regular surface.


::: Example

The surface parametrized by 
$$
\sss(u,v) = (u,v^2,v^3) \,, \quad \forall (u,v) \in \R^2
$$
is not regular. This is because
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,0) \,, \quad
\sss_v = (0,2v,3v^2)
$$
and therefore 
$$
\sss_v(u,0) = (0,0,0) \,, 
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly dependent along the line
$$
L = \{ (u,0) \divider u \in \R \} \,.
$$
Hence $\sss$ is not a regular chart.

Looking at Figure @fig-plot-cusp, it is clear that $\SSS$ is not regular, since $\SSS$ has a cusp along the line $L$.

## Level surfaces



::: Definition
### Level surface

Let $f \colon \R^3 \to \R$ be smooth. The **level surface** associated with $f$ is the set
$$
\SSS_f := f^{-1}(0) = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider f(x,y,z) = 0  \} \,.
$$

:::


We now give a result concerning regularity of level surfaces. The proof, rather technical, is based on the Implicit Function Theorem and can be
found in Proposition 3.1.25 of [@abate-tovena]. We decide to omit it.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-level-surface}

Let $V \subseteq \R^3$ be an open set and $f \colon V \to \R$ be smooth. Consider the level surface
$$
\SSS_f = \{ (x,y,z) \in V \divider f(x,y,z) = 0  \} \,.
$$
Suppose that 
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Then $\SSS_f$ is a regular surface.

:::



::: Example

We want to determine if the set defined by the equation
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}  
$$
is a regular surface. Note that $\SSS$ is a unit cylinder: From Example \ref{example-unit-cylinder} we already know that $\SSS$ is a regular surface.

Let us prove that $\SSS$ is regular by using Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface}. To this end, define the open set
$$
V := \R^3 \smallsetminus \{ (0,0,z) \divider z \in \R \} \,.
$$
Note that $V$ is obtained by removing the $z$-axis from $\R^3$. Also define  the function $f \colon \R^3 \to \R$ by
$$
f(x,y,z) := x^2 + y^2 -1 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) = ( 2x, 2y, 0 ) \neq 0  \,, \quad 
\forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\SSS = \SSS_f \,,
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} we conclude that 
$\SSS$ is a regular surface.

:::




::: Example
### Circular cone

We saw that the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} \,.
$$
is not a surface. However the positive sheet 
$$
\SSS^+ := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \,, \,  z>0  \} \,.
$$
is a regular surface, see @fig-positive-cone Indeed, define the open set 
$$
V := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider z > 0 \} 
$$
and  the function $f \colon V \to \R$ by
$$
f(x,y,z) := x^2 + y^2 - z^2 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) = ( 2x, 2y, -2z ) \neq 0  \,, \quad 
\forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\SSS^+ = \SSS_f \,,
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} we conclude that 
$\SSS$ is a regular surface. 

As a side note, a regular atlas for $\SSS^+$ is given by $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$ where $\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is defined by
$$
\sss (u,v) := (u,v,\sqrt{u^2 + v^2}) \,.

## Reparametrizations


We have defined the reparametrization of curves. In a similar way, one can reparametrize surface charts.


::: Definition

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3 \,, \quad 
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3 \,,
$$ 
are surface charts. We say that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a **reparametrization** of $\sss$ if there exists a diffeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U \,,
$$
such that 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi \,,
$$
that is,
$$
\widetilde{\sss}( \tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) = \sss (  \Phi ( \tilde{u},\tilde{v}) ) \,, \quad \forall \,\, (\tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) \in 
\widetilde{U} \,.
$$
We call $\Phi$ a **reparametrization map**.
:::



![Schematic illustration of surface chart $\sss$ and reparametrization $\widetilde{\sss}$.](/images/surface_reparametrization.png){width=80%}


We will show that reparametrizations of regular charts are regular. To prove this, first we need to recall the chain rule for multivariable functions.

::: Remark
### Chain rule

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets, 
$$
f \colon U \to \R^3 
$$
is smooth, and 
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U
$$
is a diffeomorphism. Define $\tilde{f} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ by composition:
$$
\tilde{f} := f \circ \Phi \,.
$$
Explicitly, the above means
$$
\tilde{f}( \tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) = f (  \Phi ( \tilde{u},\tilde{v}) ) \,, \quad \forall \,\, (\tilde{u},\tilde{v} ) \in 
\widetilde{U} \,.
$$
We denote the components of $f, \tilde{f}$ and $\Phi$ by
$$
\tilde{f} = (\tilde{f}^1, \tilde{f}^2, \tilde{f}^3) \,, \quad 
f = (f^1,f^2,f^3) \,, \quad 
\Phi = (\Phi^1, \Phi^2) \,. 
$$
The Jacobians are
$$
J \tilde{f} = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 \tilde{f}^1_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 \tilde{f}^2_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^2_{\tilde v}  \\
 \tilde{f}^3_{\tilde u}  & \tilde{f}^3_{\tilde v}
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad
J f = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {f}^1_{u}  &  {f}^1_{v}  \\
 {f}^2_{u}  &  {f}^2_{v}  \\
 {f}^3_{u}  &  {f}^3_{v}
\end{array}
\right) \,, \quad 
J \Phi = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {\Phi}^1_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 {\Phi}^2_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^2_{\tilde v}  
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$

The chain rule states that
$$
J \tilde{f} (\tilde u, \tilde v) = Jf ( \Phi (\tilde u, \tilde v) ) \,
J\Phi (\tilde u, \tilde v) \,.
$$
By expanding the above identity we obtain the chain rule in vectorial form
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{u}} (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) & = 
f_u ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{u}}^1 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) + f_v ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{u}}^2 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) \\ 
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{v}} (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) & = 
f_u ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{v}}^1 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) + f_v ( \Phi(\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) ) \Phi_{\tilde{v}}^2 (\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}) 
\end{align*}
As done previously, we introduce compact notation for reparametrizations and chain rule. Specifically, we denote the components of the diffeomorphism $\Phi$ by
\begin{align*}
\Phi^1 \quad & \leadsto \quad (\tilde u, \tilde v) \mapsto u (\tilde u, \tilde v)  \\
\Phi^2 \quad & \leadsto \quad (\tilde u, \tilde v) \mapsto v (\tilde u, \tilde v) 
\end{align*}
Accordingly, the Jacobian of $\Phi$ is denoted as:
$$
J \Phi = \left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 {\Phi}^1_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^1_{\tilde v}  \\
 {\Phi}^2_{\tilde u}  &  {\Phi}^2_{\tilde v}  
\end{array}
\right)   \quad \leadsto \quad 
\left(   
\begin{array}{cc}
 \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde v}  \\
 \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde u}  &  \dfrac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde v}
\end{array}
\right)  \,.
$$
Hence, the chain rule in vectorial form reads
\begin{align*}
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{u}}  & = 
f_u  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{u}} + f_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{u}} \\ 
\tilde{f}_{\tilde{v}}  & = 
f_u  \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{v}}  + f_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{v}} 
\end{align*}

:::




We will now prove that the reparametrization of a regular chart is regular.



::: {.Proposition  #proposition-transition-maps}

Suppose that $U, \widetilde{U} \subseteq \R^2$ are open sets and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3 
$$ 
is a regular chart. Assume given a diffeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{U} \to U \,.
$$
The reparametrization $\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \R^3$ defined by 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} = \sss \circ \Phi
$$
is a regular chart.

:::


::: Proof

Since $\sss$ is a regular chart we have that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Hence
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \,.
$$
To see that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is regular it is sufficient to prove that
$$
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde u} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde v} \neq 0 \,.
$${#eq-change-chart-1}
By chain rule we have
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{u}}  & = 
\sss_u  \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{u}} + \sss_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{u}} \\ 
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde{v}}  & = 
\sss_u  \, \frac{\partial u}{\partial \tilde{v}}  + \sss_v  \frac{\partial v}{\partial \tilde{v}}

By the properties of vector product we get
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde u} \times \widetilde{\sss}_{\tilde v} & =

## Transition maps



Consider the situation in which two regular charts have overlapping image.  
It is natural to ask wether these maps are reparametrizations of each
other on the overlapping region, see @fig-transition-maps. If such reparametrization exists, it is called a transition map.

### Transition map

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,, \quad
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \subseteq \SSS
$$
be regular charts. Assume that the images of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ overlap, that is,
$$
I := \sss (U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
The set $I$ is open in $\SSS$, since it is intersection of open sets. Define the sets
$$
V := \sss^{-1}(I) \subseteq U \,, \quad  \widetilde{V} := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} (I) \subseteq \widetilde{U} \,,
$$
The sets $V$ and $\widetilde{V}$ are open and by construction
$$
\sss(V) = \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{V} ) = I \,.
$$
Therefore they are well defined the restrictions
$$
\sss |_{V} \colon V \to I \,, \quad 
\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}} \colon \widetilde{V} \to I \,,
$$
which are homeomorphisms. The homeomorphism
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad \Phi := \sss^{-1} \circ \widetilde{\sss}
$$
is called a **transition map** from $\sss$ to $\widetilde{\sss}$.

The theorem below states that transition maps between regular charts are diffeomorphisms. The proof is slightly technical and is based on the Implicit Function Theorem. We decide to omit it. The interested reader can find a proof at Page 117 of [@pressley].


::: {.Theorem #theorem-transition-map}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface. The transition maps between regular charts are diffeomorphisms. 

:::


We can now use Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map} to show that
transition maps are reparametrizations.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-transition-map}

Let $\SSS$ be a regular surface and 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,, \quad
\widetilde{\sss} \colon \widetilde{U} \to \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \subseteq \SSS
$$
be regular charts. Assume that the images of $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ overlap, that is,
$$
\sss (U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Then there exist open sets 
$$
V \subseteq U \,, \quad  \widetilde{V} \subseteq \widetilde{U} \,,
$$
and a diffeomorphism 
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V
$$
such that $\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}}$ is a reparametrization of $\sss |_{V}$, that is,
$$
\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}} = (\sss |_{V}) \circ \Phi \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

Define
$$
I:=\sss (U) \cap \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{U}) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
Note that this set is open in $\SSS$, being intersection of open sets.
Set 
$$
V := \sss^{-1} (  I  ) \,, \quad 
\widetilde{V} := \widetilde{\sss}^{-1} (   I   ) \,.
$$
The sets $V$ and $\widetilde{V}$ are open, since $\sss$ and $\widetilde{\sss}$ are homeomorphisms, and hence are continuous. By construction we have
$$
\sss(V) = \widetilde{\sss} (\widetilde{V}) = I \,.
$$
Therefore they are well defined the restrictions
$$
\sss |_{V} \colon V \to I \,, \quad 
\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}} \colon \widetilde{V} \to I \,,
$$
which are homeomorphisms. Consider the transition map
$$
\Phi \colon \widetilde{V} \to V \,, \quad \Phi := \sss^{-1} \circ \widetilde{\sss} \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map} we know that $\Phi$ is a diffeomorphism. Hence 
$$
\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}} = (\sss |_{V}) \circ \Phi \,,
$$
with $\Phi$ diffeomorphism, showing that $\widetilde{\sss} |_{\widetilde{V}}$ is a reparametrization of $\sss |_{V}$.

Proposition \ref{proposition-transition-map} allows us to define properties of surfaces using charts, as long as we check that the property in question does not depend on reparametrization.

## Functions between surfaces


We would like to define a concept of smooth function 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 \,,
$$
where $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are regular surfaces. So far we know what a smooth function from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$ is. The idea is to use surface charts to define such $f$.



::: {.Definition  #definition-smooth-map-surface}

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces and let 
$$
f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2 
$$
be a map. We say that:

- $f$ is smooth at $\pp \in \SSS_1$ if there exist charts $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS_i$ for $i=1,2$ such that
$$
\pp \in \sss_1(U_1)\,, \quad f(\pp) \in \sss_2(U_2) 
$$
and 
$$
(\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1 )  \colon U_1 \to U_2
$$
is smooth.

- $f$ is smooth if it is smooth for each $\pp \in \SSS_1$.

- $f$ is a diffeomorphism if $f$ is smooth and invertible, with smooth inverse.

:::




![Sketch function $f$ smooth at $\pp$ between the surfaces $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$.](/images/surface_smooth_map.png){width=70%}





::: Remark

- Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} makes sense because $\sss_2^{-1}$ exists.

- The map $\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1$ is only defined for $\xx \in U_1$ such that
$$
f ( \sss_1 (\xx) ) \in \sss_2 (U_2) \,.
$$

- The function $\sss_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \sss_1$ maps from $\R^2$ into $\R^2$, therefore differentiability is intended in the classical sense.

- Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} does not depend on the choice of charts $\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$

> Indeed, suppose that $\widetilde{\sss}_{i} \colon \widetilde{U}_i \to {\SSS}_i$ are charts such that 
$$
\pp \in \widetilde{\sss}_1( \widetilde{U}_1) \,, \quad  f(\pp) \in \widetilde{\sss}_2(\widetilde{U}_2) \,.
$$
In particular we have
$$
 \sss_i(U_i) \cap \widetilde{\sss}_i (\widetilde{U}_i) \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
As $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are regular surfaces, by Theorem \ref{theorem-transition-map} there exist open sets
$$
V_i \subseteq U_i \,, \quad \widetilde{V}_i \subseteq \widetilde{U}_i \,,
$$
and transition maps 
$$
\Phi_i \colon \widetilde{V}_i \to V_i
$$
which are diffeomorphisms and satisfy
$$
\widetilde{\sss}_i = \sss_i \circ \Phi_i \,.
$$
Hence
\begin{align*}
\widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1 & =
\widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ ( \sss_2 \circ \sss_2^{-1} ) \circ f \circ  ( \sss_1 \circ \sss_1^{-1} ) \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1  \\
& = ( \widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ  \sss_2 ) \circ ( \sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1 ) \circ (\sss_1^{-1}  \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1 )  \\
& = \Phi_2^{-1} \circ ( \sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1 )  \circ \Phi_1^{-1} \,.
\end{align*}
Since $\Phi_i^{-1}$ and $\sss_2^{-1}  \circ f \circ   \sss_1$ are smooth, we conclude that
$$
\widetilde{\sss}_2^{-1} \circ f \circ \widetilde{\sss}_1
$$
is smooth. Hence Definition \ref{definition-smooth-map-surface} does not depend on the choice of charts.
:::




::: Proposition

If $f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2$ and $g \colon \SSS_2 \to \SSS_3$ are smooth maps (resp. diffeomorphisms) between surfaces, then the composition 
$$
(g \circ f) \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_3
$$
is smooth (resp. a diffeomorphisms).


:::


::: Proof

Fix $\pp \in \SSS_1$ and choose charts
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS_i 
$$
such that 
$$
\pp \in \sss_1 (U_1) \,, \quad
f(\pp) \in \sss_2 (U_2) \,, \quad
g(f(\pp)) \in \sss_3 (U_3) \,.
$$
Since $f$ and $g$ are smooth we have that the maps
$$
\sss_2^{-1} \circ f  \circ \sss_1 \,, \quad \sss_3^{-1} \circ  g \circ \sss_2  \,,
$$
are smooth. Hence
$$
\sss_3^{-1} \circ ( g \circ f ) \circ \sss_1 = ( \sss_3^{-1} \circ  g \circ \sss_2 ) \circ (\sss_2^{-1} \circ f  \circ \sss_1)  
$$
is smooth, ending the proof.
:::




::: Definition

Let $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ be regular surfaces. We say that $\SSS_1$ and $\SSS_2$ are diffeomorphic if there exists $f \colon \SSS_1 \to \SSS_2$ diffeomorphism.

:::


The idea is that two diffeomorphic surfaces are essentially the same. Indeed, it is immediate to show that being diffeomorphic is an equivalence relation on the set of regular surfaces.






## Tangent space


We have seen that tangent vectors to regular curves allow to define the Frenet Frame, curvature and torsion. Eventually, these quantities are sufficient to characterize a curve. The anolgue concept of tangent vector for surfaces is called the tangent space. To avoid clumsy terminology, we 
make the following assumption.


::: Assumption

From now on, all the surfaces will be regular and all the charts will be regular.

:::


::: Definition
### Tangent vector and space

Let $\SSS$ be a surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. A **tangent vector** to $\SSS$ at 
$\pp$ is any vector $\vv \in \R^3$ such that
$$
\vv = \dg(0) \,,
$$
where $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3$ is a smooth curve such that
$$
\g (-\e , \e) \subseteq \SSS \,, \quad \g(0) = \pp \,,
$$
where $\e>0$. The **tangent space** of $\SSS$ at $\pp$ is the set of all such vectors. 

:::



![Tangent space $T_p \SSS$ of surface $\SSS$ at the point $\pp$. A tangent vector $\vv$ coincides with $\dg(0)$ for some $\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \SSS$ such that $\g(0)= \pp$.](/images/tangent_space.png){width=80%}



Let us start with the most basic example. We want to compute the tangent space to an open set in $\R^2$. 


::: Example

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and $\pp \in U$. Then 
$$
T_p U = \R^2 \,.
$$

> Proof. Let $\vv \in T_p U$. By definition there exists a smooth curve
$$
\gamma \colon (-\e,\e) \to U
$$
such that $\g(0) = \pp$ and $\dg(0)=\vv$. Since $U \subseteq \R^2$, it follows that $\g$ is a plane curve, so that 
$$
\vv = \dg (0) \in \R^2 \,.
$$
Conversely, let $\vv \in \R^2$. Since $\pp \in U$ and $U$ is open, there
exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(p) \subseteq U$. Define the curve
$$
\g \colon (-\e,\e) \to \R^3 \,, \quad \g(t):= \pp + t \vv \,.  
$$
By construction
$$
\g(-\e,\e) \subseteq B_{\e} (\pp) \subseteq U \,, \quad \g(0) = \pp \,, \quad \dg(0)= \vv \,,
$$
showing that $\vv \in T_p U$.

:::


In the above we have seen that $T_p U = \R^2$ is a vector space. This property holds in general for $T_p \SSS$ with $\SSS$ regular surface.


::: Proposition

Let $\SSS$ be a (regular) surface and $\pp \in \SSS$. Let $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ be a chart at $\pp$. such that $\sss$


:::





::: Remark
### Tangent space and derivations

Definition of tangent plane depends on the fact that $\SSS$ is contained in $\R^3$. This is a serious drawback in many applications, as the surface $\SSS$ does not necessarily need to be Euclidean. There is a way to get rid of such dependence, and give an *intrinsic* definition of tangent plane, depending only on the point $\pp$ and the surface $\SSS$. 

The basic idea is as follows: If $U \subseteq \R^2$ is open and $\pp \in U$, then $T_p U = \R^2$. We can associate to any point $\vv \in T_p U$ a directional derivative
$$
\vv = (v_1,v_2) \mapsto \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial v} \right|_p =
v_1 \, \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial x_1} \right|_p +
v_2 \, \left. \frac{\partial }{\partial x_2} \right|_p 
$$
acting on smooth functions $f \colon U \to \R$. The above directional derivative is called a **derivation**.

The point is that derivations do not need to be defined through vectors, but as linear operators $D$ acting on smooth functions $f \colon U \to \R$, and such that the Leibnitz rule holds:
$$
D(fg) = f(\pp) D(g) + g(\pp) D(f) 
$$
where $f,g \colon U \to \R$ are smooth. The tangent plane at p can then be defined as
$$
T_p U = \{ D \, \mbox{ derivation at  } \pp \} \,.
$$
Therefore $T_p U$ is a subset of the dual space of smooth functions. 

It is possible to do such construction directly on $\SSS$, by introducing the concepts of **germ** of a function and of **algebra** of derivations.
An in depth discussion can be found in Chapter 3.4 of [@abate-tovena].
