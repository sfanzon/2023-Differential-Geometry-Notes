# Surfaces


Curves are 1D objects in $\R^3$, parametrized via functions $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$. 
There is only one available direction in which to move on a curve:

- $t \mapsto \g(t)$ moves forward on the curve 
- $t \mapsto \g(-t)$ moves backward on the curve

Surfaces are 2D objects in $\R^3$. There are two directions in which one can move on a surface.

::: Question

How to dercribe a surface mathematically?

:::


A curve $\Gamma \subseteq \R^3$ can be described with one function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$. The idea is that $\Gamma$ looks locally like $\R$.


![A curve $\Gamma$ can be described by a function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$.](/images/curves_example_2.png){width=60%}


A surface $\SSS$ cannot be described, in general, with just one function $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$, with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open set. The idea is that, to describe $\SSS$, one needs to piece together many local **charts** $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open. Such charts have to cover the whole surface $\SSS$, e.g.
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$

## Preliminaries


Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we need to establish
some basic notation and terminology regarding the topology of $\R^n$ and smooth maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.



### Topology of $\R^n$


The Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ is denoted by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 }\,, \quad \xx = (x_1 , \ldots, x_n) \in \R^n \,.
$$
The Euclidean norm induces the distance
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \| \xx - \yy \| =   \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 } \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Euclidean Topology 

The pair $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space. The topology induced by the metric $d$ is called the Euclidean topology, denoted by $\TT$. In this chapter we will always assume that $\R^n$ is equipped with the Euclidean topology $\TT$.

:::


::: Definition 
### Open Sets

A set $U \subseteq \R^n$ is open if for all $\xx \in U$ there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx) \subseteq U$, where
$$
B_{\e}(\xx) := \{  \yy \in \R^n \divider \| \xx - \yy  \| < \e   \}
$$
is the open ball of radius $\e>0$ and centered at $\xx$. In this case we denote $U \in \TT$, with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology in $\R^n$.

:::



::: Definition 
### Closed Sets 

A set $V \subseteq \R^n$ is closed if $V^c := \R^n \smallsetminus U$ is open. 

:::




::: Example

- The $n$-dimensional unit sphere
$$
\sphere^n = \{ \xx \in \R^{n+1} \divider \| x \| = 1 \}
$$
is not open in $\R^{n+1}$, since for any $\xx \in \sphere^n$ we have
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq \sphere^{n} \,. 
$$

- The $n$-dimensional unit cube 
$$
C := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| <1  \}
$$
is open in $\R^n$, since one can always find $\e>0$ small enough so that
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq C \,. 
$$

- The set 
$$
V := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \geq 1  \}
$$
is closed, since $V^c = C$ is the unit cube, which is open.

:::



::: Definition 
### Subspace Topology

Given a subset $A \subseteq \R^n$ the subspace topology on $A$ is the family of sets
$$
\TT_A := \{  U \subseteq A \divider \exists \,\, W \in \TT \st U = A \cap W  \} \,.
$$
If $U \in \TT_A$ we say that $U$ is open in $A$.

:::





### Smooth functions


We recall some basic facts about smooth functions from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$. For a vector valued function $f \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ we denote its components by 
$$
f = (f_1,\ldots,f_m) \,.
$$


::: Definition
### Continuous Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx \in U$ if $\forall \, \e>0$, \, $\exists \, \delta > 0$ such that 
$$
\|  \xx - \yy  \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad 
\| f(\xx) - f (\yy) \| < \e \,.
$$
We say that $f$ is continuous in $U$ if it is continuous for all $\xx \in U$.
:::


::: Remark

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$, with $U,V$ open. We have that $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $U$, for all $A$ open in $V$.

:::


::: Definition
### Homeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$ with $U,V$ open. We say that $f$ is a homeomorphism if $f$ is continuous and there exists inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$ continuous.

:::



::: Definition
### Differentiable Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $\xx \in U$ if there exists a linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ such that
$$
\lim_{\e \to 0} \   \frac{ f(\xx + \e \pmb{h} )  - f(\xx) - \e \, df_{\xx}(\pmb{h}) }{ \e } = 0 \,,
$$
for all $\pmb{h} \in \R^n$, where the limit is taken in $\R^m$. The map $df_{\xx}$ is called the **differential** of $f$ at $\xx$. 

:::


We denote by $\{\ee_i\}_{i=1}^n$ the standard basis of $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Partial Derivative

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open be differentiable. The partial derivative of $f$ at $\xx \in U$ in direction $\ee_i$ is given by
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} := \lim_{\e \to 0}  \frac{ f( \xx + \e \ee_i ) - f(\xx) }{ \e } \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition
### Jacobian Matrix

The linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ can be represented in matrix form, with respect to the Euclidean basis, by the Jacobian matrix
$$
Jf(x):= \left( \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} \right)_{i,j}  \in \R^{m \times n} \,.
$$
If $m=n$ then $Jf \in \R^{n \times n}$ is a square matrix and we can compute its determinant, denoted by
$$
\det Jf \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition
### Multi-index notation

For a multi-index
$$
\alpha := (\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n) \in \N^n
$$
we denote by 
$$
|\alpha|:= \sum_{i=1}^n   |\alpha_i|
$$
the length of the multi-index. 

:::




::: Definition
### Smooth Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is smooth if the derivatives 
$$
\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|} f}{d\xx^\alpha} :=  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{ \partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{ \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} \, f
$$
exist for each multi-index $\alpha \in \N^n$. Note that in this case all the derivatives of $f$ are automatically continuous.

:::




::: Notation
### Gradient and partial derivatives

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ be smooth. We denote the partial derivatives by 
$$
\partial_{x_i} f := \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} \,, \quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j} f := \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} \,,
\quad 
\partial_{x_i x_j x_k} f := \frac{\partial^3 f}{\partial x_i \partial x_j \partial x_k} \,.
$$

For $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R$ smooth we denote the **gradient** by
$$
\nabla f (\xx) = \left(  f_{x_1}(\xx) , \ldots ,  f_{x_n}(\xx) \right) \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

The functions $f \colon \R^2 \to \R$ and $g \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ defined by
$$
f(x,y) := \cos(x)y \,, \quad 
g(x,y) := (x^2,y^2,x-y)
$$
are both smooth.

:::



::: Definition
### Diffeomorphism

Let $f \colon U \to V$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ and $V \subseteq \R^n$ open. We say that $f$ is a **diffeomorphism** between $U$ and $V$ if $f$ is smooth and there exists 
smooth inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$.

:::



We recall, without proof, the Inverse Function Theorem. Please note that in the statement the function $f$ is defined from $\R^n$ into $\R^n$.



::: Theorem
### Inverse Function Theorem

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a smooth function and
$$
\det J f(\xx_0) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for some $\xx_0 \in U$. Then there exist open sets $U_0 , V \subseteq \R^n$ such that $\xx_0 \in U_0$, $f(\xx_0) \in V$ and $f \colon U_0 \to V$ is a diffeomorphism.


:::


::: Warning 

Even if 
$$
\det J f(\xx) \neq 0 \,,
$$
for all $\xx \in U$, it is not guaranteed that $f$ is a diffeomorphism between $U$ and $f(U)$.

:::


Non-vanishing Jacobian determinant is a necessary condition for being a diffeomorphism.



::: Proposition

Let $f \colon U \to \R^n$ with $U \subseteq \R^n$ open. Suppose $f$ is a diffeomorphism on $U$. Then 
$$
\det Jf (\xx) \neq 0 \,, \quad   \forall \, \xx \in \R^n \,.
$$

:::



::: Example

Define $f \colon \R^2 \to \R^2$ by
$$
f(x,y) := (\cos(x) \sin(y), \sin(x) \sin(y)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
J f (x,y) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 - \sin(x) \sin(y)  &   \cos(x) \cos(y) \\
 \cos(x) \sin(y)    &   \sin(x) \cos(y)
\end{array}
\right) \,.
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\det Jf(x,y) & = - \sin^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) - \cos^2(x) \cos(y) \sin(y) \\
             & = - \sin(y) \cos(y) \\
             & = - \frac{1}{2} \sin(2y) \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
$$
\det Jf(x,y) \neq 0 \quad \iff \quad 
y \neq \frac{n \pi}{2} \,, \,\, n \in \N \,.
$$
Hence $f$ is a diffeomorphism away from the lines
$$
L_n := \left\{ \left(x, \frac{n \pi}{2} \right) \divider x \in \R \right\} \,.
$$

## Definition of Surface


We can finally give the definition of surface in $\R^3$.


::: Definition
### Surface

Let $\SSS \subseteq \R^3$ be a connected set. We say that $\SSS$ is a **surface** if for every point $\pp \in \SSS$ there exist an open set  $U \subseteq \R^2$ and a smooth map
$$
\sss \colon U \to  \sss(U) \subseteq \SSS \,
$$
such that 

- $\pp \in \sss(U)$
- $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$
- $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $U$ and $\sss(U)$


Further:

- The homeomorphism $\sss$ is called a **surface chart**. 
- For each $i \in I$ suppose to have a surface chart
$$
\sss_i  \colon U_i \to \sss(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
We say that the family 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I}
$$ 
is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i \in I} \sss_i(U_i)  \,.
$$


:::




::: Remark

- A surface chart $\sss$ is a map from $\R^2$ into $\R^3$.


- Given a chart $\sss \colon U \to \sss(U)$, the set $U$ is open in $\R^2$ while $\sss(U)$ is open in $\SSS$ with the subspace topology. This means that there exists $W \subseteq \R^3$ open such that
$$
\sss(U) = W \cap \SSS \,.
$$

- The omeomorphism condition is saying that $\sss(U) \subseteq \SSS$ looks locally (around $\pp$) like an open set $U \subseteq \R^2$.

:::

::: Notation

- Points in $U$ will be denoted with the pair $(u,v)$.

- Partial derivatives of a chart $\sss = \sss (u,v)$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss_u := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial u} \,, \quad 
\sss_v := \frac{\partial \sss }{\partial v} \,.
$$
Similar notations are adopted for higher order derivatives, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
\sss_{uu} & := \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial u^2} \,, 
& \sss_{uv} & :=  \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial u \partial v} \,, \\
\sss_{vu} & := \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial v  \partial u  } \,,  
& \sss_{vv} & :=  \frac{\partial^2 \sss }{\partial v^2 } \,, \\
\end{align*}

- Components of $\sss$ will be denoted by
$$
\sss = (\sigma^1, \sigma^2, \sigma^3) \,.
$$

:::




::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Planes in $\R^3$ are surfaces with atlas containing one chart. Namely, a plane
$\pi \subseteq \R^3$ is described by
$$
\pi  = \{  \xx  \in \R^3 \divider \xx \cdot \ww = \lambda \} \,.
$$
Let

- $\pp,\pmb{q} \in \R^3$ be ortoghonal to each other and to $\ww$.
- $\pmb{a} \in \pi$ be any point in the plane.


If $\xx \in \pi$ then $\xx-\pmb{a}$ is parallel to the plane and $\pi$ can be
equivalently represented as
$$
\pi = \{ \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} \,.
$$
Define the map
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \pi \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \,.
$$
We have:

- $\sss$ is smooth.
- $\R^2$ is obviously open.
- $\sss(\R^2)$ is open in $\pi$, since $\sss(\R^2) = \pi$.
- The inverse of $\sss$ is 
$$
\sss^{-1} \colon \pi \to \R^2 \,, \quad 
\sss^{-1} (\xx) = ( (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pp , (\xx - \pmb{a}) \cdot \pmb{q}  ) \,.
$$
- As $\sss^{-1}$ is continuous, then $\sss$ is a homeomorphism between $\R^2$ and $\pi$. 


Therefore $\sss$ is a chart for $\pi$. Since
$$
\sss(\R^2) = \pi \,,
$$
we have that $\{\sss\}$ is an atlas for $\pi$, and hence $\pi$ is a surface.

### Unit cylinder

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.

$\SSS$ is a surface with an atlas consisting of two charts:
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss_i(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
for $i=1,2$, where
$$
U_1 := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, \quad 
U_2 := \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,.

::: Important


Consider again the unit cylinder 
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.

Define the map

\sss \colon U \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss (u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)

where
$$
U:= [ 0, 2 \pi ] \times \R \,.
$$
Clearly we have 
$$
\sss(U) = \SSS \,.
$$
However $\{\sss\}$ is not an atlas for $\SSS$, since $\sss$ is not a chart. This is because $\sss$ is not invertible, as for example
$$
\sss(0,0) = \sss(2\pi,0) \,. 
$$
Therefore $\sss$ cannot be an omeomorphism between $U$ and $\SSS$.

$$
We have that $\Gamma_f$ is a surface with atlas given by

\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss \}
$$
where $\sss \colon U \to \Gamma_f$ is
$$

Let us conclude the section with an example of a set which is not 
a surface.



::: Example
### Circular cone

Consider the circular cone
$$
\SSS := \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = z^2  \} \,.
$$
Then $\SSS$ is not a surface. This is essentially consequence of
the fact that
$$
\SSS \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is a disconnected set.


To see that $\SSS$ is not a surface, suppose there exists an 
atlas $\{\sss_i\}$ of $\SSS$
$$
\sss_i \colon U_i \to \sss_i(U_i) \subseteq \SSS \,.
$$
In particular there exists a chart $\sss_{i_0}$ such that 
$$
\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(U_{i_0}) \,.
$$
Let $\xx_0 \in U_{i_0}$ be the point such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(\xx_0) = \zero \,.
$$
Consider the ball $B_{\e}(\xx_0)$ for any $\e > 0$. Since $\sss_{i_0}$ is a homeomorphism, we deduce that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))
$$
is open in $\SSS$. Hence there exists an open set $W$ in $\R^3$ such that
$$
\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) = \SSS \cap W \,.
$$
As $\zero \in \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ and $W$ is open in $\R^3$, it follows that
$W$ contains points of both $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, with
$$
\SSS^- := \SSS \cap \{ z < 0 \}   \,, \quad
\SSS^+ := \SSS \cap \{ z > 0 \}   \,.
$$

>This is because $W$ contains a ball of suitable radius $\delta>0$ and centered at $\zero$.

Hence $\sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0))$ contains points of $\SSS^-$ and $\SSS^+$, implying that 
$$
V := \sss_{i_0}(B_{\e}(\xx_0)) \smallsetminus \{\zero\}
$$
is disconnected, with disconnection given by
$$
V = ( V \cap \SSS^- ) \cup (V \cap \SSS^+) \,.
$$
However $V$ is homeomorphic to 
$$
B_{\e} (\xx_0) \smallsetminus \{ \xx_0 \} \,,
$$
which is instead connected. Contradiction. Hence $\SSS$ is not a surface.

## Regular Surfaces


We have defined a regular curve to be a map $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ such that
$$
\norm{\g(t)} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
This allowed us to define tangent vectors and, eventually, Frenet frame.

We want to do something similar for surfaces: We look for a condition that eventually will allow us to define tangent planes. This is why we introduce **regular charts** and **regular surfaces**.



::: Definition
### Regular Chart

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open. A map
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v)  \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called a **regular chart** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
:::


The following gives more insight into the regularity condition.


::: Proposition

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and consider a map
$$
\sss  \colon U \to \R^3 \,.
$$
They are equivalent:

1. $\sss$ is a regular chart.
2. The differential $d\sss_{\xx} \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is injective for all $\xx \in U$.
3. The Jacobian matrix
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
has rank $2$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
4. It holds
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad  \forall \, (u,v) \in U \,.
$$


:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 4.* 

By the properties of vector product, we have that
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \, \quad \, \forall (u,v) \in U 
$$
if and only if $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent for all $(u,v) \in U$.


*Part 2. Equivalence of Point 2 and Point 3.* 

The differential $d\sss_{\xx} \colon \R^2 \to \R^3$ is represented in matrix form by the Jacobian
$$
J\sss (u,v) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\sigma^1_{u}  &  \sigma^1_{v} \\
\sigma^2_{u}  &  \sigma^2_{v} \\
\sigma^3_{u}  &  \sigma^3_{v} \\
\end{array} 
\right)
$$
By standard linear algebra results, $J\sss$ has rank 2 if and only if $d\sss$ is injective. 

*Part 3. Equivalence of Point 1 and Point 3.*

A $3 \times 2$ matrix has rank 2 if and only if its columns are linearly independent. Since the columns of $J\sss$ are $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$, we 
conclude that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent.

:::



We are now ready to define regular surfaces.


::: Definition
### Regular surface

Let $\SSS$ be a surface. Let 
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i \in I} \,,
$$
be an atlas for $\SSS$. We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is a **regular atlas** if 
the map $\sss_i$ is a regular chart for all $i \in I$. We say that $\SSS$ is a **regular surface** if there exists a regular atlas for $\SSS$.
:::







::: Example
### 2D Plane in $\R^3$

Let $\pmb{a}, \pp, \pmb{q} \in \R^3$, with $\pp$ and $\pmb{q}$ orthogonal. We have shown that the plane
$$
\pi = \{ \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \divider u,v \in \R \} 
$$
is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{\sss\}$, where
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \pi \,, \quad \sss(u,v):= \pmb{a} + u \pp + v \pmb{q} \,.
$$
Then $\pi$ is a regular surface, because $\sss$ is a regular chart. To see this, compute
$$
\sss_u = \pp  \,, \quad \sss_v = \pmb{q} \,.
$$
Since $\pp$ and $\pmb{q}$ are orthogonal, then they are linearly independent. Thus $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent, and $\sss$ is a regular chart.

::: Example
### Unit cylinder {#example-unit-cylinder}

Consider the infinite unit cylinder
$$
\SSS  = \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
We have seen that $\SSS$ is a surface with atlas $\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_1,\sss_2\}$ where we define
$$
\sss \colon \R^2 \to \R^3   \,, \quad 
\sss(u,v):= (\cos(u),\sin(u),v)
$$
and 
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 & := \sss |_{U_1} \,,   & \sss_2 & := \sss |_{U_2} \,, \\
U_1 & := \left( 0,\frac{ 3 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,, 
& U_2 & := \left( \pi,\frac{ 5 \pi}{2} \right) \times \R \,.
\end{align*}
We have that $\SSS$ is a regular surface, since the atlas $\mathcal{A}$ is regular. Indeed:
$$
\sss_u = (-\sin(u),\cos(u),0) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,0,1) \,,
$$
and therefore
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (\cos (u), \sin(u), 0)  \,, \quad \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} = 1 \,.
$$
This implies
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (u,v) \in \R^2 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly independent. Therefore
$\sss_1$ and $\sss_2$ are regular charts, being restrictions of $\sss$.

::: Example
### Graph of a function

Let $U \subseteq \R^2$ be open and $f \colon U \to \R$ be smooth. The graph of $f$ is the set
$$
\Gamma_f := \{ (u,v,f(u,v)) \divider (u,v) \in U  \}  \,.
$$
We have seen that $\Gamma_f$ is surface with atlas given by
$\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss \}$, where $\sss \colon U \to \Gamma_f$ is
$$
\sss(u,v):=(u,v,f(u,v)) \,.
$$
We have that $\Gamma_f$ is regular, since $\mathcal{A}$ is a regular atlas.
Indeed, 
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,f_u) \,, \quad 
\sss_v = (0,1,f_v) \,,
$$
and so
$$
\sss_u \times \sss_v = (-f_u, - f_v, 1 ) \neq \zero \,,
$$
since the last component never vanishes. Therefore $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are
linearly independent and $\sss$ is a regular chart.

### Unit sphere

Consider the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
We have that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface, with regular atlas
$$
\mathcal{A} = \{ \sss_i \}_{i=1}^6 \,,
$$
defined as follows: Let 
$$
U:= \{ (u,v) \in \R^2 \colon u^2 + v^2 < 1  \}
$$
be the unit open ball in $\R^2$ and define $\sss_i \colon U \to \R^3$ by
\begin{align*}
\sss_1 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_2 (u,v) & = \left(u,v,-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}  \right) \\
\sss_3 (u,v) & = \left(u,\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2},v  \right) \\
\sss_4 (u,v) & = \left(u, -\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, v  \right) \\
\sss_5 (u,v) & = \left(\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2} , u ,v \right) \\
\sss_6 (u,v) & = \left(-\sqrt{1-u^2-v^2}, u,v,  \right) \\
\end{align*}

> Exercise: Check that $\sphere^2$ is a regular surface.

::: Remark 
### Spherical coordinates

The equivalent of polar coordinates in dimension $3$ are spherical coordinates. A point $(x,y,z) \in \R^3 \smallsetminus \{\zero\}$ can
be represented in spherical coordinates by
\begin{align*}
x & = \rho \cos (\theta)  \cos(\phi)  \\
y & = \rho \cos (\theta)  \sin(\phi) \\
z & = \rho \sin (\theta) 
\end{align*}
where 
$$
\rho:=\sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 } \,, \quad \f \in [0,2\pi] \,, \quad \theta \in \left[ -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2} \right] \,,
$$
with the angles $\f$ and $\theta$ as in Figure @fig-spherical-coordinates.

> It is clear that $z = \rho \sin(\theta)$, by basic trigonometry. To compute $x$ and $y$, we note
that the segment joining $\zero$ to $\pp$ has length 
$$
L = \rho \cos \theta \,.
$$
Therefore we get
\begin{align*}
x & = L \cos (\phi) = \rho \cos (\theta)  \cos(\phi) \\
y & = L \sin (\phi) = \rho \cos (\theta)  \sin(\phi) 
\end{align*}
concluding.

::: Example
### Unit sphere in spherical coordinates

Consider again the unit sphere in $\R^3$
$$
\sphere^2 := \{  (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1  \} \,.
$$
We want to give an alternative atlas for $\sphere^2$ based on spherical coordinates. To this end, define
$$
U := \left\{ (\theta,\phi)  \in \R^2 \divider -\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \,, \,\, 
0< \phi < 2 \pi    \right\}
$$
and $\sss \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\sss( \theta , \phi ) :=  ( \cos(\theta) \cos(\phi), \cos(\theta) \sin(\phi), \sin (\theta)  ) \,.
$$
We have:

- $\sss$ is smooth.

- $U$ is open in $\R^2$.

- Moreover
$$
\sss (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,0,z) \in \R^3 \divider x \geq 0  \} \,,
$$
as seen also in the left picture in @fig-chart-sphere. 

- The set $\sss(U)$ is evidently open in $\sphere^2$. 

- It is easy to check that $\sss$ is invertible, with continuous inverse. 

- Thus $\sss$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ into $\sss(U)$.

Let us check that $\sss$ is a regular chart:
\begin{align*}
\sss_{\theta} & = (-\sin(\theta) \cos(\phi), -\sin(\theta) \sin(\phi), \cos(\theta) ) \\
 \sss_{\phi} & = ( - \cos(\theta) \sin(\phi), \cos(\theta) \cos(\phi), 0 )  \,.
\end{align*} 
Therefore 
$$
\sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} = 
( - \cos^2(\theta) \cos(\phi), - \cos^2(\theta) \sin(\phi), - \sin(\theta) \cos ( \theta ) ) \,,
$$
from which
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} } = |\cos (\theta)| \, .
$$
Since $(\theta,\phi)\in U$, we have $\theta \in ( -\pi/2, \pi/2 )$, and so
$$
\norm{ \sss_{\theta} \times \sss_{\phi} } = |\cos (\theta)| \neq 0 \,,
$$
showing that $\sss_{\theta}$ and $\sss_{\phi}$ are linearly independent, and
$\sss$ is regular.

Since $\sss(U) \neq \sphere^2$, the chart $\sss$ does not form an atlas. We need a second chart. An option is to define $\widetilde{\sss} \colon U \to \R^3$ by
$$
\widetilde{\sss} := ( - \cos(\theta) \cos (\phi), -\sin(\theta) , - \cos (\theta) \sin(\phi)) \,.
$$
Notice that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is obtained by rotating $\sss$ by $\pi$ about the $z$-axis and by $\pi/2$ about the $y$-axis, as seen in the right picture in @fig-chart-sphere. It is an exercise to check that $\widetilde{\sss}$ is a regular chart. 

Since we have
$$
\widetilde{\sss} (U) = \sphere^2 \smallsetminus \{ (x,y,0) \in \R^3 \divider x \leq 0  \} \,,
$$
it is immediate to see that
$$
\sphere^2 = \sss(U) \cup \widetilde{\sss}(U) \,.
$$
Hence
$$
\mathcal{A} := \{   \sss , \widetilde{\sss} \} 
$$
is a regular atlas for $\sphere^2$.

Let us make an example of a non-regular surface.


::: Example

The surface parametrized by 
$$
\sss(u,v) = (u,v^2,v^3) \,, \quad \forall (u,v) \in \R^2
$$
is not regular. This is because
$$
\sss_u = (1,0,0) \,, \quad
\sss_v = (0,2v,3v^2)
$$
and therefore 
$$
\sss_v(u,0) = (0,0,0) \,, 
$$
showing that $\sss_u$ and $\sss_v$ are linearly dependent along the line
$$
L = \{ (u,0) \divider u \in \R \} \,.
$$
Hence $\sss$ is not a regular chart.

Looking at Figure @fig-plot-cusp, it is clear that $\SSS$ is not regular, since $\SSS$ has a cusp along the line $L$.

### Level set surfaces



::: Definition
### Level set surface

Let $f \colon \R^3 \to \R$ be smooth. The **level set surface** associated with $f$ is the set
$$
\SSS_f := f^{-1}(0) = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider f(x,y,z) = 0  \} \,.
$$

:::


We now give a result concerning regularity of level set surfaces. The proof, rather technical, is based on the Implicit Function Theorem and can be
found in Proposition 3.1.25 of [@abate-tovena]. We decide to omit it.


::: {.Theorem #theorem-level-surface}

Let $V \subseteq \R^3$ be an open set and $f \colon V \to \R$ be smooth. Consider the level set surface
$$
\SSS_f = \{ (x,y,z) \in V \divider f(x,y,z) = 0  \} \,.
$$
Suppose that 
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Then $\SSS_f$ is a regular surface.

:::



::: Example

We want to determine if the set defined by the equation
$$
\SSS = \{ (x,y,z) \in \R^3 \divider x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}  
$$
is a regular surface. Note that $\SSS$ is a unit cylinder: From Example \ref{example-unit-cylinder} we already know that $\SSS$ is a regular surface.

Let us prove that $\SSS$ is regular by using Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface}. To this end, define the open set
$$
V := \R^3 \smallsetminus \{ (0,0,z) \divider z \in \R \} \,.
$$
Note that $V$ is obtained by removing the $z$-axis from $\R^3$. Also define  the function $f \colon \R^3 \to \R$ by
$$
f(x,y,z) := x^2 + y^2 -1 \,.
$$
We have
$$
\nabla f (x,y,z) = ( 2x, 2y, 0 ) \neq 0  \,, \quad 
\forall \, (x,y,z) \in V \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\SSS = \SSS_f \,,
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-level-surface} we conclude that 
$\SSS$ is a regular surface.
