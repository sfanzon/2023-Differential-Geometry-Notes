# Topology


So far we have worked in $\R^n$, where for example we have the notions of open set, continuous function and compact set. Topology is what allows us to extend these notions to arbitrary sets.



::: Definition
### Topological space   {#definition-topology}

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if the following 3 properties hold:

- (A1) We have $\emptyset, X \in \TT$,

- (A2) If $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$, then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- (A3) If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

Further, we say:

- The pair $(X,\TT)$ is a **topological space**.
- The elements of $X$ are called **points**.
- The sets in the topology $\TT$ are called **open sets**.
:::




::: {.Remark  #remark-intersection}

The intersection property of $\TT$, Property (A3) in Definition \ref{definition-topology}, is 
equivalent to the following:

- (A3') If $A_1, \ldots, A_M \in \TT$ for some $M \in \N$, then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^M A_n  \in \TT \,.
$$

> The equivalence between (A3) and (A3') can be immediately obtained by induction.

:::





::: Warning

Notice:

- The union property (A2) of $\TT$ holds for an **arbitrary** number of sets, even uncountable!
- The intersection property (A3') of $\TT$ holds only for a **finite** number of sets. 

:::



There are two main examples of topologies that one should always keep in mind. 
These are:

- **Trivial topology**: The topology with the smallest possible number of sets.
- **Discrete topology**: The topology with the highest possible number of sets.



::: Definition
### Trivial topology

Let $X$ be a set. The trivial topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{  \emptyset , X \} \,.
$$

> Let us check that $\TT$ is indeed a topology. We need to verify the 3 properties of a topology:
>
>  - (A1) We clearly have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$.
>  - (A2) The only non-trivial union to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cup X = X \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>  - (A3) The only non-trivial intersection to check is the one between $\emptyset$ and $X$. We have
>  $$
    \emptyset \cap X = \emptyset \in \TT \,. 
>  $$ 
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::




::: Definition
### Discrete topology

Let $X$ be a set. The discrete topology on $X$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subset X \} \,,
$$
that is, every subset of $X$ is open.

> Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology: 
>
>  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , X \in \TT$, since $\emptyset$ and $X$ are subsets of $X$.
>  - (A2) The arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  \bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$.
>
>  - (A3) The intersection of two subsets of $X$ is still a subset of $X$. Therefore
>  $$
>  A \cap B \in \TT \,, 
>  $$
>  whenever $A, B  \in \TT$.
>
> Therefore $\TT$ is a topology on $X$.
:::




We anticipated that topology is the extension of familiar concepts of open set, continuity, etc.
that we have in $\R^n$. Let us see how the usual definition of open set of $\R^n$ can fit
in our new abstract framework of topology. 



::: Definition
### Open set of $\R^n$

Let $A \subset \R^n$. We say that the set $A$ is **open** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \xx \in A \,, \,\, \exists \, r > 0 \st B_r(\xx) \subset A \,,
$${#eq-open-set-Rn}
where $B_r(\xx)$ is the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $\xx$
$$
B_r(\xx) := \{ \yy \in \R^n \divider \norm{ \yy - \xx } < r  \} \,, 
$$
and the **Euclidean norm** of $\xx \in \R^n$ is defined by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^2 } \,.
$$

See @fig-open-set-Rn for a schematic picture of an open set.
:::

::: Definition
### Euclidean topology of $\R^n$  {#definition-euclidean-topology}

The Euclidean topology on $\R^n$ is the topology $\TT$ defined by
$$
\TT := \{ A \divider A \subset \R^n \,, \,\, A \, \mbox{ is open}  \} \,.
$$

:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, in the sense that we have to
prove that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.


::: Proof
### Well-posedness of Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}

Let us check that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$: 

  - (A1) We have $\emptyset , \R^n \in \TT$: Indeed $\emptyset$ is open because there is no point $\xx$ for which (@eq-open-set-Rn) needs to be checked. Moreover $\R^n$ is open because (@eq-open-set-Rn) holds with any radius $r>0$. 
  - (A2) Let $A_i \in \TT$ for all $i \in I$ and define the union set
  $$
  A:=\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i \,.
  $$
  We need to check that $A$ is open. Let $\xx \in A$. By definition of union, there exists an index $i_0 \in I$ such that
  $\xx \in A_{i_0}$. Since $A_{i_0}$ is open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exists $r>0$ such that 
  $B_r(\xx) \subset A_{i_0}$. As $A_{i_0} \subset A$, we conclude that $B_r(\xx) \subset A$. Thus $A$ is open and $A \in \TT$.

 - (A3) Let $A, B \in \TT$. 
  We need to check that $A \cap B$ is open. Let $\xx \in A \cap B$. Therefore $\xx \in A$ and $\xx \in B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exist $r_1,r_2>0$ such that 
  $B_{r_1}(\xx) \subset A$ and $B_{r_2}(\xx) \subset B$. Set $r := \min\{ r_1,r_2\}$. Then 
  $$
  B_r(\xx) \subset B_{r_1}(\xx) \subset A  \,, \quad 
  B_r(\xx) \subset B_{r_2}(\xx) \subset B  \,, 
  $$
  Hence $B_r(\xx) \subset A \cap B$, showing that $A \cap B$ open, so that $A \cap B \in \TT$.

 This proves that $\TT$ is a topology on $\R^n$.
:::



Let us make a basic bus useful observation: balls in $\R^n$ are open for the Euclidean topology.


::: {.Proposition   #proposition-balls-open}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology. Let $r>0$ and $\xx \in \R^n$. Then
$$
B_r(\xx) \in \TT \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We need to shown that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn). Therefore, let $\yy \in B_r(\xx)$. In particular
$$
\norm{\xx - \yy}<r \,.
$${#eq-balls-open}
Define 
$$
\e := r - \norm{\xx - \yy} \,.
$$
Note that $\e>0$ by (@eq-balls-open). We claim that 
$$
B_{\e} (\yy) \subset B_r (\xx) \,,
$${#eq-proof-ball-open}
see @fig-balls-open. Indeed, let $\zz \in B_{\e}(\yy)$. By triangle inequality we have
$$
\| \zz - \xx \| \leq \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \norm{ \yy - \zz } <  \norm{ \xx - \yy } + \e = r \,, 
$$
where we used that $\norm{\yy - \zz} < \e$ and the definition of $\e$. Hence $\zz \in B_r(\xx)$, proving 
(@eq-proof-ball-open). This proves that $B_r(\xx)$ satisfies (@eq-open-set-Rn), and is therefore
open.


:::


![The ball $B_{\e}(\yy)$ is contained in $B_r(\xx)$ if $\e := r - \norm{\xx-\yy}$.](/images/balls_open.png){#fig-balls-open width=70%}



We conclude the section with the definition of equivalent topologies.


::: Definition
### Equivalent topologies

Let X be a set and suppose that $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ are topologies on $X$. We say that 
$\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ are **equivalent** if they hold:

- For any $U \in \TT_1$ there exists $V \in \TT_2$ such that 
$$
V \subset U \,.
$$

- For any $U \in \TT_2$ there exists $V \in \TT_1$ such that 
$$
V \subset U \,.
$$
:::



::: Warning

If two topologies are equivalent, that does not mean they have the same open sets. 

:::




## Convergence

We have generalized the notion of open set to arbitrary sets. Next we generalize
the notion of convergence of sequences.

::: Definition
### Convergent sequence

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological. Consider a sequence $\{x_n\}_{n \in \N} \subset X$ and a point
$x \in X$. We say that $x_n$ converges to $x_0$ if the following property holds:
$$
\forall \, U \in \TT  \st x_0 \in U\,, \,\, \exists \, N = N(U) \in \N \st  x_n \in U \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$ {#eq-convergence}

:::


::: Notation

The convergence of $x_n$ to $x_0$ is denoted by 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \quad \mbox{ or } \quad  \lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0 \,.
$$

:::


Let us analyze the definition of convergence in the topologies we have encountered so far. We will have that:

- **Trivial topology**: Every sequence converges to every point.
- **Discrete topology**: A sequence converges if and only if it is eventually constant.
- **Euclidean topology**: Topological convergence coincides with classical notion of convergence.

We now precisely state and prove the above claims.

::: Proposition
### Convergence for trivial topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the trivial topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ \emptyset, X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. Then 
$$
x_n \to x_0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Proof

To show that $x_n \to x_0$ we need to check that (@eq-convergence) holds. Therefore, let 
$U \in \TT$ with $x_0 \in U$. We have two cases:

- $U = \emptyset$:  This case is not possible, since $x_0$ cannot be in $U$. 

- $U = X$: Take $N=1$. Since $U$ is the whole space, then $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq 1$.  

As these are all the open sets, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Proposition
### Convergence for discrete topology

Let $(X,\TT)$ be topological space, with $\TT$ the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT = \{ A  \divider A \subset X \} \,.
$$
Let $\{x_n\} \subset X$ be a sequence and $x_0 \in X$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$.
2. $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
:::



::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume that $x_n \to x_0$.*

We have to prove that $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant. To this end, let 
$$
U = \{x_0\} \,.
$$
Then $U \in \TT$. Since $x_n \to x_0$, by (@eq-convergence) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = \{x_0\}$, the above is saying that $x_n = x_0$ for all $n \geq N$. Hence $x_n$ is eventually constant. 


*Part 2. Assume that $x_n$ is eventually equal to $x_0$.*

By assumption there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-convergence-discrete}
Let $U \in \TT$ be an open set such that $x_0 \in U$. By (@eq-convergence-discrete) we have
that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::


Before proceeding to examining convergence in the Euclidean topology, let us recall the 
classical definition of convergence in $\R^n$.

::: Definition
### Classical convergence in $\R^n$

Let $\{\xx_n\} \subset \R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. We say that $\xx_n$ converges $\xx_0$ in the 
classical sense if 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \norm{\xx_n - \xx_0}  = 0 \,. 
$$
The above is equivalent to: For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$


:::


::: Proposition
### Convergence for Euclidean topology

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology.
Let $\{\xx_n\} \subset \R^n$ be a sequence and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$ a point. They are equivalent:

1. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
2. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.*

Fix $\e>0$ and consider the set
$$
U := B_{\e}(\xx_0) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-balls-open} we know that $U \in \TT$. Moreover $\xx_0 \in U$.
By the convergence $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = B_{\e}(\xx_0)$, the above reads
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,,
$$
showing that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.


*Part 2. Assume $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.*


Let $U \in \TT$ be such that $\xx_0 \in U$. By definition of Euclidean topology, this means that 
there exists $r>0$ such that 
$$
B_r(\xx_0) \subset U \,.
$$
As $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < r \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
\xx_n \in B_{r}(\xx_0) \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $B_r(\xx_0) \subset U$, we have proven that
$$
\xx_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ is arbitrary, we conclude that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ with respect to $\TT$.
:::


::: Notation

Since classical convergence in $\R^n$ agrees with topological convergence with respect to $\TT$, we will just say that $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in $\R^n$ without ambiguity.

:::










## Metric spaces


We will now define a class of topological spaces known as metric spaces.




::: Definition 
### Distance

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$$
d \colon X \times X \to \R
$$
such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

- (M1) Positivity: The distance is non-negative
$$
d(x,y) \geq 0 \,.
$$ 
Moreover 
$$
d(x,y) = 0 \quad \iff x=y \,.
$$

- (M2) Symmetry: The distance is symmetric
$$
d(x,y) = d(y,x) \,.
$$

- (M3) Triangle Inequality: It holds
$$
d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z) \,.
$$
:::




::: Definition
### Metric space

Let $X$ be a set and $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ be a distance on $X$. 
We say that the pair $(X,d)$ is a **metric space**.
:::




::: Example
### $\R^n$ as metric space

The Euclidean norm naturally induces a distance over $\R^n$ by setting
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \norm{ \xx - \yy } \,.
$$
Then $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

> It is trivial to check that the Euclidean distance satisfies (M1) and (M2). 
> To show (M3), recalling the triangle inequality in $\R^n$:
$$
\| \xx + \yy \| \leq \| \xx \|   + \| \yy \| \,,
$$
for all $\xx , \yy \in \R^n$. Using the above we obtain
\begin{align*}
d(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \| \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \| \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \| + \| \zz - \yy \|  \\
             & = d (\xx,\zz) + d (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d$ satisfies (M3). This prove that $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

:::



::: Example
### $p$-distance on $\R^n$


For $\xx,\yy \in \R^n$ and $p \in [1,\infty)$ define 
$$
d_p ( \xx, \yy ) := \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p   \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Note that $d_2$ coincides with the Euclidean distance.
For $p = \infty$ we set
$$
d_{\infty} ( \xx, \yy ) := \max_{i = 1 \ldots, n} |x_i - y_i|  \,.
$$
We have that $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space. 

> Indeed properties (M1)-(M2) hold trivially. The triangle inequality is also 
> trivially satisfied by $d_{\infty}$. We are left with checking the triangle inequality
> for $d_p$ with $p \geq 1$. To this end, define
$$
\| \xx \|_p :=  \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i|^p  \right)^{\frac1p} \,.
$$
Minkowski's inequality, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality), states that 
$$
\| \xx + \yy \|_p \leq   \| \xx  \|_p  +  \|  \yy \|_p \,,
$$
for all $\xx ,\yy \in \R^n$. Therefore
\begin{align*}
d_p(\xx,\yy) & = \| \xx - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = \| (\xx - \zz) + (\zz - \yy) \|_p \\
             & \leq  \| \xx - \zz \|_p + \| \zz - \yy \|_p  \\
             & = d_p (\xx,\zz) + d_p (\zz,\yy) \,,
\end{align*}
proving that $d_p$ satisfies (M3). Hence $(\R^n,d_p)$ is a metric space.
:::




A metric $d$ on a set $X$ naturally induces a topology which is **compatible** with the metric.



::: Definition
### Topology induced by the metric  {#definition-metric-topology}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We define the topology $\TT_d$ **induced by the metric** $d$ as the
collection of sets $U \subset X$ that satisfy the following property:
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subset U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$. This is defined by 
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$


:::


We need to check that the above definition is well-posed, that is, we need to show 
that $\TT_d$ is actually a topology on $X$. The proof follows, line by line, the proof that the Euclidean topology is indeed a topology, see proof immediately below Definition \ref{definition-euclidean-topology}. This is left
as an exercise.





::: Example
### Topology induced by Euclidean distance

Consider the metric space $(\R^n,d)$ with $d$ the Euclidean distance. Then $\TT_d$ is equivalent to the Euclidean topology on $\R^n$. 

> The claim follows immediately by definition.
:::



::: Example
### Discrete distance

Let $X$ be a set. Define the function $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ by
$$
d(x,y) := 
\begin{cases}
	0 & \mbox{ if } \, x = y \\
	1 & \mbox{ if } \, x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$
Then $(X,d)$ is a metric space, and $d$ is called the **discrete distance**. Moreover $\TT_d$
is equivalent to the **discrete topology** on $X$.


> Exercise: Prove that $(X,d)$ is a metric space and that $\TT_d$ is equivalent to the discrete topology.

:::




The following proposition is very useful to proving that certain sets are
open in $\TT_d$. The proof is left as an exercise.


::: Proposition

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then:

- For all $x \in X$, $r>0$ we have $B_r(x) \subset \TT_d$.
- $U \in \TT_d$ if and only if
$$
U = \bigcup_{ i \in I } B_{r_i}(x_i) \,,
$$
with $I$ family of indices and $x_i \in X$, $r_i > 0$.

:::



Similarly to the definition of equivalent topologies, we can define
equivalent metrics.


::: Definition
### Equivalent metrics

Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. We say that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are
equivalent if
$$
\TT_{d_1} = \TT_{d_2} \,.
$$

:::


The following proposition gives a practical way to check if two metrics are equivalent.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-equivalent-metrics}


Let $X$ be a set and $d_1,d_2$ be metrics on $X$. They are equivalent:

1. $d_1$ and $d_2$ are equivalent metrics.
2. There exists a constant $\alpha > 0$ such that
$$
\frac{1}{\alpha} \, d_2 (x,y) \leq d_1 (x,y) \leq \alpha \, d_2(x,y) \,, \quad \forall \, x,y \in X \,.
$$


:::


The proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} is trivial, and is left as an exercise.




::: Example

Let $p > 1$. The metrics $d_p$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ are equivalent.

> This follows from Proposition \ref{proposition-equivalent-metrics} and the estimate
$$
d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \leq d_p (\xx,\yy) \leq n \, d_{\infty} (\xx,\yy) \,, \quad \forall \xx \,, \, \yy \in \R^n \,.
$$
:::




::: Warning

If two metrics are equivalent, that does not mean they have the same balls. For example the balls of the metrics $d_1$, $d_2$ and $d_{\infty}$ on $\R^n$ look very different, see @fig-balls-R2.

:::

## Hausdorff spaces





::: Definition
### Metrizable space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that the topology $\TT$ is metrizable if there
exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that
$$
\TT = \TT_d \,,
$$
with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.

:::






## Connected topological spaces



::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are just $\emptyset$ and $X$.
