# Surfaces


Curves are 1D objects in $\R^3$, parametrized via functions $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$. 
There is only one available direction in which to move on a curve:

- $t \mapsto \g(t)$ moves forward on the curve 
- $t \mapsto \g(-t)$ moves backward on the curve

Surfaces are 2D objects in $\R^3$. There are two directions in which one can move on a surface.

::: Question

How to dercribe a surface mathematically?

:::


A curve $\Gamma \subseteq \R^3$ can be described with one function $\g \colon (a,b) \to \Gamma$. The idea is that $\Gamma$ looks locally like $\R$.

A surface $\SSS$ cannot be described, in general, with just one function $\sss \colon U \to \SSS$, with $U \subseteq \R^2$ open set. The idea is that, to describe $\SSS$, one needs to piece together many local **charts** $\sss_i \colon U_i \to \SSS$ with $U_i \subseteq \R^2$ open. Such charts have to cover the whole surface $\SSS$, e.g.
$$
\SSS = \bigcup_{i} \sss_i (U_i) \,.
$$

## Preliminaries


Before proceeding with the formal definition of surface, we need to establish
some basic notation and terminology regarding the topology of $\R^n$ and smooth maps from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.



### Topology of $\R^n$

The Euclidean norm on $\R^n$ is denoted by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 }\,, \quad \xx = (x_1 , \ldots, x_n) \in \R^n \,.
$$
The Euclidean norm induces the distance
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \| \xx - \yy \| =   \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 } \,.
$$

::: Definition
### Euclidean Topology 

The pair $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space. The topology induced by the metric $d$ is called the Euclidean topology, denoted by $\TT$. In this chapter we will always assume that $\R^n$ is equipped with the Euclidean topology $\TT$.

:::


::: Definition 
### Open Sets

A set $U \subseteq \R^n$ is open if for all $\xx \in U$ there exists $\e>0$ such that $B_{\e}(\xx) \subseteq U$, where
$$
B_{\e}(\xx) := \{  \yy \in \R^n \divider \| \xx - \yy  \| < \e   \}
$$
is the open ball of radius $\e>0$ and centered at $\xx$. In this case we denote $U \in \TT$, with $\TT$ the Euclidean topology in $\R^n$.

:::



::: Definition 
### Closed Sets 

A set $V \subseteq \R^n$ is closed if $V^c := \R^n \smallsetminus U$ is open. 

:::




::: Example

- The $n$-dimensional unit sphere
$$
\sphere^n = \{ \xx \in \R^{n+1} \divider \| x \| = 1 \}
$$
is not open in $\R^{n+1}$, since for any $\xx \in \sphere^n$ we have
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq \sphere^{n} \,. 
$$

- The $n$-dimensional unit cube 
$$
C := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| <1  \}
$$
is open in $\R^n$, since one can always find $\e>0$ small enough so that
$$
B_{\e} (\xx) \not\subseteq C \,. 
$$

- The set 
$$
V := \{ \xx \in \R^n \divider |x_1| + \ldots + |x_n| \geq 1  \}
$$
is closed, since $V^c = C$ is the unit cube, which is open.

:::



::: Definition 
### Subspace Topology

Given a subset $A \subseteq \R^n$ the subspace topology on $A$ is the family of sets
$$
\TT_A := \{  U \subseteq A \divider \exists \,\, W \in \TT \st U = A \cap W  \} \,.
$$
If $U \in \TT_A$ we say that $U$ is open in $A$.

:::





### Smooth functions


We recall some basic facts about smooth functions from $\R^n$ into $\R^m$.

::: Definition
### Continuous Function

Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is continuous at $\xx \in U$ if $\forall \, \e>0$, \, $\exists \, \delta > 0$ such that 
$$
\|  \xx - \yy  \| < \delta \quad \implies \quad 
\| f(\xx) - f (\yy) \| < \e \,.
$$
We say that $f$ is continuous in $U$ if it is continuous for all $\xx \in U$.
:::


**Remark**: Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$, with $U,V$ open. We have that $f$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(A)$ is open in $U$, for all $A$ open in $V$.


**Homeomorphism**: Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to V \subseteq \R^m$ with $U,V$ open. We say that $f$ is a homeomorphism if $f$ is continuous and there exists inverse $f^{-1} \colon V \to U$ continuous.


**Differentiable Function**: Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is differentiable at $\xx \in U$ if there exists a linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ such that
$$
\lim_{\e \to 0} \   \frac{ f(\xx + \e \pmb{h} )  - f(\xx) - \e \, df_{\xx}(\pmb{h}) }{ \e } = 0 \,,
$$
for all $\pmb{h} \in \R^n$. The map $df_{\xx}$ is called the **differential** of $f$ at $\xx$. 


We denote by $\{\ee_i\}$ the standard basis of $\R^n$. 

**Partial Derivative**: Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open be differentiable. The partial derivative of $f$ at $\xx \in U$ in direction $\ee_i$ is given by
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} := \lim_{\e \to 0}  \frac{ f( \xx + \e \ee_i ) - f(\xx) }{ \e } \,.
$$


**Jacobian Matrix**: The linear map $df_{\xx} \colon \R^n \to \R^m$ can be represented in matrix form by  


**Multi-index Notation**: For a multi-index
$$
\alpha := (\alpha_1, \ldots , \alpha_n) \in \N^n
$$
we denote by 
$$
|\alpha|:= \sum_{i=1}^n   |\alpha_i|
$$
the length of the multi-index. 



**Smooth Function**: Let $f \colon U \subseteq \R^n \to \R^m$ with $U$ open. We say that $f$ is smooth if the derivatives 
$$
\frac{\partial^\alpha f}{d\xx^\alpha} :=  \frac{\partial^{\alpha_1}}{ \partial x_1^{\alpha_1}} \cdots \frac{\partial^{\alpha_n}}{ \partial x_n^{\alpha_n}} \, f
$$
exist for each multi-index $\alpha \in \N^n$. Note that in this case all the derivatives of $f$ are automatically continuous.


**Example**






## Smooth surfaces

::: Definition

A set $\SSS \subset \R^3$ is a **surface** if for every point $\pp \in \SSS$ there exist open sets $U \subset \R^2$, $V \subset \R^3$ such that

- $\pp \in V$,
- $U$ is diffeomorphic to $V \cap \SSS$.

Further:

- A diffeomorphism of $U$ into $V \cap \SSS$, denoted by
$$
\sss \colon U \to  V \cap \SSS \,
$$
is called a **surface chart**. 
- For each $i \in I$ suppose to have a surface chart
$$
\sss_i  \colon U_i \to V_i \cap \SSS \,.
$$
We say that the family $\{ \sss_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an **atlas** of $\SSS$ if 
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} (V_i \cap \SSS ) = \SSS \,.
$$
:::
 
Note that a surface chart $\sss$ is a map from $\R^2$ into $\R^3$.
Points in $U$ will be denoted by the pair $(u,v)$, while points on $\SSS$ by $\pp$ and points in $\R^3$ by $\xx$.


::: Definition

Let $U \subset \R^2$ be open A surface chart 
$$
\sss = \sss(u,v)  \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called **regular** if the partial derivatives
$$
\sss_u(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{du}(u,v) \,, \quad
\sss_v(u,v) = \frac{d\sss}{dv}(u,v) 
$$
are linearly independent vectors of $\R^3$ for all $(u,v) \in U$.
:::




::: Definition

Let $U \subset \R^2$ be open. A surface chart 
$$
\sss \colon U \to \R^3
$$
is called a **conformal parametrization** if the first fundamental form satisfies
$$
E \, du^2 + F \, du \ dv + G \, dv^2 = \lambda(u,v)  ( du^2 +  dv^2)
$$
for some smooth function $\lambda  \colon U \to \R$.


:::




::: Definition

Let $\SSS$ be a surface and $\sss \colon U \to V \cap \SSS$  a surface chart. The principal unit normal to $\SSS$ is 
$$
\mathbf{N} = \frac{ \sss_u \times \sss_v }{ \norm{\sss_u \times \sss_v} } \,. 
$$
:::



Denote by 
$$
\sphere^2 = \{ \xx \in \R^3 \, \colon \, \norm{\xx} = 1 \} 
$$
the unit sphere in $\R^3$.

::: Definition

Let $\SSS$ be a surface and denote by $\mathbf{N}$ the principal unit normal. The **Gauss map** of $\SSS$ is the map $G \colon \SSS  \to \sphere^2$ defined by 
$$
G(\pp):= \NN(\pp) \,.
$$
The **Weingarten map** is the derivative of the Gauss map, denoted by $\WW \colon T_{\pp}\SSS  \to T_{G(\pp)} \sphere^2$.
