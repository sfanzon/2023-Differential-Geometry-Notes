# Topology


::: Definition

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if they hold:

- The empty set $\emptyset$ and $X$ belong to $\TT$,

- Let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$. Then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- If $A,B \in \TT$ then
$$
A \cap B \in \TT \,.
$$

::: Definition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are just $\emptyset$ and $X$.

::: Definition 

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$$
d \colon X \times X \to \R
$$
such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

1. The distance is non-negative
$$
d(x,y) \geq 0 \,.
$$ 
Moreover $d(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x=y$.

2. The distance is symmetric:
$$
d(x,y) = d(y,x) \,.
$$

3. The triangle inequality holds:
$$
d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z) \,.
$$


We say that the pair $(X,d)$ is a **metric space**.

### Topology induced by the metric

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We define the topology $\TT$ **induced by the metric** as the
collection of sets $U \subset X$ that satisfy the following property:
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subset U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$. This is defined by 
$$
B_r(x) := \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$
