# Parametrized curves

Let us recall the definition of **parametrized curve**.


::: Definition
### Parametrized curve

A **parametrized curve** in $\R^n$ is a function 
$$
\gamma \ \colon  (a,b) \to \R^n \,.
$$
where

$$
(a,b) = \{ t \in \R \ \colon \ a < t < b \} \,,
$$
with
$$
- \infty \leq a < b \leq \infty \,.
$$
The **components** of $\gamma(t) \in \R^n$ are denoted by 
$$
\gamma(t) = ( \gamma_1(t), \ldots, \gamma_n(t) ) \,,
$$
where the components are functions
$$
\gamma_i \ \colon (a,b) \to \R \,, 
$$
for all $i = 1, \ldots, n$.
:::


As we already mentioned, the aim of the course is to study curves by **differentiating** them. Let us see what that means for curves.

::: Definition
### Smooth functions

A scalar function $f \ \colon (a,b) \to \R$ is called **smooth** if the derivative
$$
\frac{d^n f}{dt^n}
$$
exists for all $n \geq 1$ and $t \in (a,b)$. 
:::

We will denote the first and second derivatives of $f$ as follows:
$$
\dot f :=  \frac{d f}{dt} \,, \quad  \ddot f := \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2} \,.
$$


::: Example
The function $f(x)=x^4$ is smooth, with
\begin{align}
& \frac{d f}{dt}  = 4x^3 ,\,\, \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2}  = 12 x^2 \,, \\
& \frac{d^3 f}{dt^3}  = 24 x ,\,\, \frac{d^4 f}{dt^4} = 24  \,, \\
& \frac{d^n f}{dt^n}  = 0  \, \text{ for all } \, n \geq 5  \,.
\end{align}
Other examples smooth functions are polynomials, as well as
$$
f(t) = \cos(t) , \,\, f(t) = \sin(t) \,, \,\, f(t) = e^t \,.
$$
:::


::: Definition 

Let $\gamma \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ with 
$$
\g(t) = ( \g_1(t), \ldots, \g_n(t) ) 
$$
be a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **smooth** if the components
$$
\g_i \ \colon (a,b) \to \R
$$
are smooth for all $i=1,\ldots,n$. The derivatives of $\g$ are 
$$
\frac{d^k\gamma}{dt^k}  := \left(  \frac{d^k\gamma_1}{dt^k} , \ldots, \frac{d^k\gamma_n}{dt^k} \right)  
$$
for all $k \in \N$. As a shorthand, we will denote the first derivative of $\g$ as 
$$
\dot \g := \frac{d\gamma}{dt} = \left(  \frac{d\gamma_1}{dt} , \ldots, \frac{d\gamma_n}{dt} \right)  
$$
and the second by
$$
\ddot \g := \frac{d^2\gamma}{dt^2} = \left(  \frac{d^2\gamma_1}{dt^2} , \ldots, \frac{d^2\gamma_n}{dt^2} \right)   \,.
$$
:::

In @fig-smooth-curve we skectch a smooth and a non-smooth curve. Notice that the curve on the right is smooth, except for the point $x$.


![Example of smooth and non-smooth curves](/images/smooth_curve.png){#fig-smooth-curve width=70%}


We will work under the following assumption.

::: {.Assumption .unnumbered}

All the parametrized curves in this lecture notes are assumed to be **smooth**.

:::


::: Example

The circle 
$$
\g (t) = (\cos(t),\sin(t))
$$
is a smooth parametrized curve, since both $\cos(t)$ and $\sin(t)$ are smooth functions. We have
$$
\dot \g = (-\sin(t),\cos(t)) \,.
$$
For example the derivative of $\g$ at the point $(0,1)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g( \pi/2) = (-\sin(\pi/2),\cos(\pi/2)) = (-1,0) \,.
$$
The plot of the circle and the derivative vector at $(-1,0)$ can be seen in @fig-circle-tangent.

## Tangent vectors


Looking at @fig-circle-tangent, it seems like the vector 
$$
\dot \g(\pi/2) = (-1,0)
$$
is **tangent** to the circle at the point
$$
\g(\pi/2) = (0,1) \,.
$$
Is this a coincidence? Not that all. Let us look at the definition of derivative at a point:
$$
\dot \g (t) := \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta} \,.
$$
If we just look at the quantity
$$
\frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta} 
$$
for non-negative $\delta$, we see that this vector is parallel to the chord joining $\g(t)$ to $\g(t + \delta)$, as shown in @fig-tangent below. As $\delta \to 0$, the length of the chord tends to zero. However the **direction** of the chord becomes **parallel** to that of the tangent vector of the curve $\g$ at $\g(t)$. Since 
$$
\frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta}  \to \dot \g(t)
$$
as $\delta \to 0$, we see that $\dot \g (t)$ is **parallel** to the tangent of $\g$ at $\g(t)$, as showin in @fig-tangent.


![Approximating the tangent vector](/images/tangent.png){#fig-tangent width=70%}



The above remark motivates the following definition. 

::: Definition
### Tangent vector {#definition-tangent}

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. The tangent vector to $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$ is defined as 
$$
\tau:= \dot \g(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Example
### Tangent vector to helix

The helix is described by the parametric curve 
$$
\g \ \colon \R \to \R^3
$$
with
$$
\g_1(t) = \cos (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_2(t) = \sin (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_3(t) = t . 
$$
This is plotted in @fig-helix-tangent below. The tangent vector at point $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g (t) = ( -\sin(t), \cos(t) , 1) \,.
$$
For example in @fig-helix-tangent we plot the tangent vector at time $t = \pi/2$, that is,
$$
\dot\g(\pi/2) = (-1,0,\pi/2) \,. 
$$
The above looks very similar to the tangent vector to the circle. Except that there is a $z$ component, and that component is constant and equal to $1$. Intuitively this means that the helix is *lifting* from the plane $xy$ with constant speed with respect to the $z$-axis. We will soon give a name to this concept.

::: Remark
### Avoiding potential ambiguities

Sometimes it will happen that a curve self intersects, meaning that there are two time instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ and a point $p \in \R^n$ such that
$$
p = \g(t_1) = \g(t_2)\,.
$$
In this case there is ambiguity in talking about the tangent vector at the point $p$: in principle there are two tangent vectors $\dot\g(t_1)$ and  $\dot\g(t_2)$, and it could happen that 
$$
 \dot\g(t_1) \neq  \dot\g(t_1)\,.
$$
Thus the concept of tangent at $p$ is not well-defined. 
We need then to be more precise and talk about tangent at a certain **time-step** $t$, rather than at some **point** $p$. We however do not amend Definition \ref{definition-tangent}, but you should keep this potential ambiguity in mind.
:::


::: Example
### A self intersecting curve

For example consider $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined as
$$
\g_1(t) = \sin (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_2(t) = \sin (t) \cos(t) \, .
$$
This is plotted in @fig-eight below. The orgin $(0,0)$ is a point of self-intersection, meaning that 
$$
\g (0) = \g (\pi) = (0,0) \,.
$$
The tangent vector at point $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g(t) = (\cos(t), \cos^2(t) - \sin^2(t) )
$$
and therefore we have two tangents at $(0,0)$, that is,
$$
\tau_1 = \dot\g(0) = (1,1) \,, \,\,
\tau_2 = \dot\g(\pi) = (-1,1) \,.
$$

## Length of curves


For a vector $v \in \R^n$ with components 
$$
v=(v_1,\ldots,v_n),
$$
its **length** is defined by
$$
\norm{v}:= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2 } \,.
$$
The above is just an extension of the Pythagoras theorem to $\R^n$, and the length of $v$ is computed from the origin.


![Interpretation of $\norm{v}$ in $\R^2$](/images/pythagoras.png){width=70%}


If we have a second vector $u \in \R^n$, then the quantity 
$$
\norm{u-v}:= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (u_i-v_i)^2 } 
$$
measures the length of the difference between $u$ and $v$.


![Interpretation of $\norm{u-v}$ in $\R^2$](/images/length_difference.png){width=70%}


We would like to define the concept of **length** of a curve. Intuitively, one could proceed by approximation as in the figure below.

![Approximating the length of $\g$](/images/length_approx.png){width=70%}

In formulae, this means choosing some time instants
$$
t_0, \ldots, t_m \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The length of the segment connecting $\g(t_{i-1})$ to $\g(t_i)$ is given by 
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.
$$
Thus 
$$
L(\g) \approx \sum_{i=1}^m \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.  
$$ {#eq-approx-length}
Intuitively, if we increase the number of points $t_i$, the quantity on the RHS of (@eq-approx-length) should approximate $L(\g)$ better and better. Let us make this precise.



::: Definition
### Partition

Let $(a,b)$ be an interval. A partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $[a,b]$ is a vector of time instants
$$
\mathcal{P} = (t_0,\ldots, t_k) \in [a,b]^{m+1}
$$
with 
$$
t_0 = a < t_1 < \ldots < t_{m-1} < t_m = b \,.
$$
If $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, we define its maximum length as
$$
\norm{\mathcal{P}} := \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} |t_{i} - t_{i-1}| \,.
$$
:::

Note that $\norm{\mathcal{P}}$ measures how fine the partition $\mathcal{P}$ is.





::: Definition
### Length of approximating polygonal curve

Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve and $\mathcal{P}$ a partition of $[a,b]$. We define the length of the polygonal curve connecting the points
$$
\g(t_0)\,, \,\, \g(t_1) \,,  \,\, \ldots, \,\, \g(t_m)
$$
as
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P}) := \sum_{i=1}^m \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.
$$
:::


If $\norm{\mathcal{P}}$ becomes smaller and smaller, that is, the partition $\mathcal{P}$ is finer and finer, it is reasonable to say that 
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P})
$$
is approximating the length of $\g$. We take this as definition of length.


::: Definition
### Rectifiable curve and length

Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **rectifiable** if the limit
$$
L(\g) = \lim_{ \norm{P} \to 0}   \ L(\g,\mathcal{P})
$$
exists finite. In such case we call $L(\g)$ the **length** of $\gamma$.
:::


This definition definitely corresponds to our geometrical intuition of length of a curve. 

::: Question
How do we use such definition in practice to compute the length of a given curve $\g$?
:::

Thankfully, when $\g$ is smooth, the length $L(\g)$ can be characterized in terms of $\dot\g$. Indeed, when $\delta$ is small, then the quantity 
$$
\norm{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}
$$
is approximating the length of $\g$ between $\g(t)$ and $\g(t + \delta)$. Multiplying and dividing by $\delta$ we obtain
$$
\frac{\norm{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}}{\delta} \, \delta 
$$
which for small $\delta$ is close to 
$$
\norm{\dot\g(t)} \,\delta \,.
$$
We can now divide the time interval $(a,b)$ in steps $t_0, \ldots, t_m$ with $|t_{i}-t_{i-1}| < \delta$ and obtain 
\begin{align}
\norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1}) } & = \frac{\norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1})}}{ |t_{i}-t_{i-1}| } |t_{i}-t_{i-1}| \\
& \approx \norm{ \dot\g(t_i)} \delta 
\end{align}
since $\delta$ is small. Therefore
$$
L(\g) \approx \sum_{i=1}^m  \norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1})} 
\approx \sum_{i=1}^m   \norm{\dot\g(t_i)} \,\delta \,.
$$
The RHS is a Riemann sum, therefore 
$$
  L(\g) \approx \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \,.
$$

The above argument can be made rigorous, as we see in the next theorem.


![Approximating $L(\g)$ via $\dot\g$](/images/length_derivative.png){width=70%}




::: Theorem
### Characterizing the length of $\g$  {#theorem-length}

Assume $\g \ \colon [a,b] \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve, with $[a,b]$ bounded. Then $\g$ is rectifiable and
$$
L(\g) = \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \,. 
$$ {#eq-length-formula}

:::

::: Proof

*Step 1. The integral in (@eq-length-formula) is bounded.*  
Since $\g$ is smooth, in particular $\dot \g$ is continuous. Since $[a,b]$ is bounded, then $\dot \g$ is bounded, that is 
$$
\sup_{t \in [a,b]} \norm{\dot \g(t)} \leq C
$$
for some constant $C \geq 0$. Therefore 
$$
\int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \leq C (b-a) < \infty \,.
$$

*Step 2. Writing (@eq-length-formula) as limit.*  
Recalling that 
$$
L(\g) = \lim_{\norm{\mathcal{P}} \to 0} \ L(\g,\mathcal{P}) \,,
$$
whenever the limit is finite, in order to show (@eq-length-formula)  we then need to prove
$$
L(\g,\mathcal{P}) \to \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt
$$
as $\norm{\mathcal{P}} \to 0$. Showing the above means proving that: for every $\e > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that, if $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ such that $\norm{ \mathcal{P} }<\delta$, then 
$$
\left|    \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt -  L(\g , \mathcal{P} )        \right| < \e \,.
$${#eq-length-formula-1}


*Step 3. First estimate in (@eq-length-formula-1).*  
This first estimate is easy, and only relies on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. To be more precise, we will show that each polygonal has shorter length than $\int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt$. To this end, take an arbitrary partition $\mathcal{P} = (t_0, \ldots, t_m)$ of $[a,b]$. Then for each $i = 1,\ldots,m$ we have
$$
\norm{  \g(t_i) - \g (t_{i-1}) } = \norm{  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i}  \dot\g (t)\, dt } \leq   \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i}\norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt   
$$
where we used the Fundamental Theorem of calculus, and usual integral properties. Therefore by definition
\begin{align}
L(\g,\mathcal{P} ) & = \sum_{i=1}^m  \norm{  \g(t_i) - \g (t_{i-1}) } \\ 
& \leq \sum_{i=1}^m  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i} \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt \\
& = \int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt \,.
\end{align}
We have then shown 
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P}) \leq \int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt
$${#eq-length-formula-2}
for all partitions $\mathcal{P}$.  


*Step 4. Second estimate in (@eq-length-formula-1).*  
The second estimate is more delicate. We need to carefully construct a polygonal so that its length is close to $\int_a^b \norm{ \dot \g} \,dt$. This will be possible by uniform continuity of $\dot\g$. Indeed, note that $\dot \g$ is continuous on the compact set $[a,b]$. Therefore it is uniformly continuous by the Heine-Borel Theorem. Fix $\e>0$. By uniform continuity of $\dot \g$ there exists $\delta >0$ such that
$$
|t-s| < \delta \implies \norm{ \dot\g(t)-\dot\g(s) } < \frac{ \e }{b-a} \,.
$$ {#eq-length-formula-uc}
for all $t,s \in [a,b]$. Let $\mathcal{P} = (t_0, \ldots, t_m)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with $\norm{\mathcal{P}} < \delta$. Recall that 
$$
\norm{\mathcal{P}} = \max_{i=1,\ldots ,m} |t_i - t_{i-1}| \,.
$$
Therefore the condition  $\norm{\mathcal{P}} < \delta$ implies 
$$
|t_i - t_{i-1}| < \delta 
$$ {#eq-length-formula-3}
for each $i = 1, \ldots, m$. For all $i = 1, \ldots, m$ and $s \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$ we have
\begin{align}
\g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) & = \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }  \dot\g(t)\, dt \\
                      & =  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i } \dot\g(s) +  (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt \\
                      & = ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \dot\g(s) + \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt
\end{align}
Therefore
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  = \norm{ ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \dot\g(s) + 
 \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
$${#eq-length-formula-4}
We can now use the reverse triangle inequality
$$
| \| x\| - \norm{y}| \leq \norm{x-y}\,, 
$$
for all $x,y \in \R^n$, which implies
$$
 \norm{x+y}  = \norm{x - (-y)} \geq \| x \| - \norm{y}
$$
for all $x,y \in \R^n$. Applying the above to (@eq-length-formula-4) we get
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  \geq
 ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)} - 
\norm{ \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
$${#eq-length-formula-5}
By standard properties of integral we also have
$$
\norm{ \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
\leq 
\int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt\,,
$$
so that (@eq-length-formula-5) implies
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \geq ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)}   - \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt\,.
$${#eq-length-formula-6}
Since $t,s \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$, then 
$$
|t-s| \leq | t_{i} - t_{i-1} |   <  \delta
$$ 
where the last inequality follows by (@eq-length-formula-3). Thus by uniform continuity (@eq-length-formula-uc) we get
$$
\norm{ \dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s) } < \frac{\e}{b-a} \,.
$$
We can therefore further estimate (@eq-length-formula-6) and obtain
\begin{align}
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } & \geq ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)}   - \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt \\
& \geq  ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)} -  ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \frac{\e}{b-a}    \, dt \,.
\end{align}
Dividing the above by $t_i - t_{i-1}$ we get
$$
\frac{ \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } }{ t_i - t_{i-1}  } \geq
 \norm{\dot\g(s)} - \frac{\e}{b-a}  \,.
$$
Integrating the above over $s$ in the interval $[t_{i-1}, t_i ]$ we get
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  \geq \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i } \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds  - \frac{\e}{b-a} (t_i - t_{i-1}) \,.
$$
Summing over $i=1,\ldots,m$ we get
$$
L(\mathcal{P},\g) \geq \int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds - \e
$$ {#eq-length-formula-7}
since
$$
\sum_{i=1}^m (t_i - t_{i-1}) = t_m - t_0 = b - a \,. 
$$

*Conclusion.*    
Putting together (@eq-length-formula-2) and (@eq-length-formula-7) we get 
$$
\int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds - \e   \leq L(\mathcal{P},\g) 
\leq  \int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds
$$
which implies (@eq-length-formula-1), concluding the proof.

Thanks to the above theorem we have now a way to compute $L(\g)$. 
Let us check that we have given a meaningful definition of length by computing $L(\g)$ on known examples.



::: Example
### Length of Circle

The circle of radius $R$ is parametrized by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t))
$$
and 
\begin{align}
\norm{\dot\g(t)} & = \sqrt{ \dot \g_1^2(t) +   \dot \g_2^2(t)      } \\
                & = R \sqrt{ \sin^2(t) + \cos^2 (t)} = R\,.
\end{align}
Therefore 
$$
L(\g) = \int_{0}^{2\pi}  \norm{  \dot\g(t)} \, dt = \int_0^{2\pi} R \, dt = 2 \pi R
$$
as expected.
:::




::: Example
### Length of helix

Let us consider one full turn of the Helix of radius $R$ and rise $H$. This is parametrized by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t) ,Ht)
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t) , H) \,,
$$
and 
\begin{align}
\norm{ \dot \g(t)  } & = \sqrt{  \dot\g_1^2 + \dot\g_2^2 + \dot\g_3^2 } \\
                    & = \sqrt{ R^2\sin^2(t) + R^2\cos^2(t) + H^2 } = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
\end{align}
Therefore 
$$
L(\g) = \int_0^{2\pi} \norm{ \dot\g(t) } \, dt = 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,. 
$$

## Arc-length

We have just shown in Theorem \ref{theorem-length} that the length of a regular curve $\g \ \colon [a,b] \to \R^n$ with $[a,b]$ bounded is given by
$$
L(\g) = \int_a^b \norm{ \dot\g (t)} \,dt \,.
$$
Using this formula, we introduce the notion of length of a portion of $\g$.




::: Definition
### Arc-length

Let $\g \, \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a curve, with $(a,b)$ possibly unbounded. We define the **arc-length** of $\g$ starting at the point $\g(t_0)$ as the function $s \colon \R \to \R$ defined by
$$
s(t) := \int_{t_0}^t  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau) }\, d\tau \,.
$$

:::


![Arc-length of $\g$ starting at $\g(t_0)$](/images/arc_length.png){width=70%}


::: Remark

A few remarks:

- Arc-length is well-defined 

     >Indeed, $\g$ is smooth, and so $\dot \g$ is continuous. WLOG assume $t \geq t_0$. Then
     $$
     s(t) = \int_{t_0}^t  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau) }\, d\tau \leq (t-t_0) \max_{ \tau \in [t_0,t] } \norm{\dot\g(\tau)} < \infty \,.
     $$

- We always have
$$
s(t_0)=0\,.
$$

- We have
$$
t > t_0   \implies  s(t) \geq 0 
$$
and 
$$
t < t_0   \implies  s(t) \leq 0 \,.
$$

- Choosing a different starting point changes the arc-length by a **constant**: 

     >For example define $\tilde{s}$ as the arc-length starting from $\tilde{t}_0$
     $$
     \tilde{s}(t) := \int_{\tilde{t}_0}^t \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau  \,.
     $$
     Then by the properties of integral
     \begin{align}
     s(t) & = \int_{t_0}^t \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \\
      & = \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau +
         \int_{\tilde{t}_0}^{t} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \\
      & = \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau + \tilde{s}(t) \,.
     \end{align}
     Hence 
     $$
     s = c + \tilde{s} 
     $$
     with 
     $$
     c := \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \,.
     $$
     Note that $c$ is the arc-length of $\g$ between the starting points $\g(t_0)$ and $\g(\tilde{t}_0)$.

- The arc-length is a differentiable function, with
$$
\dot s(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{t_0}^t \norm{\dot\g (\tau)} \, d\tau =
 \norm{\dot\g (t)} \,.
$$
     
     >Since $\dot\g$ is continuous, the above follows by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

::: Example
### Circle

The circle of radius $R$ is parametrized by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t)) \,, \quad \norm{\dot\g(t)} = R \,.
$$
Therefore, for any fixed $t_0 \in [0,2\pi]$ we have
$$
s(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t}  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau)} \, d\tau = \int_{t_0}^{t} R \, d\tau = (t - t_0)  R \,.
$$
In particular we see that $\dot s = R$ is constant.

::: Example
### Logarithmic spiral

The Logarithmic spiral is defined by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ with
$$
\g(t) = (e^{kt} \cos(t), e^{kt} \sin(t)) \,,
$$
where $k \in \R$, $k \neq 0$, is called the **growth factor**.
Then 
$$
\dot \g_1(t) = e^{kt} ( k \cos(t) - \sin(t) )
$$
$$ 
\dot \g_2(t) = e^{kt} ( k \sin(t) + \cos(t) ) 
$$
and so, after some calculations,
$$
\norm{\dot\g(t)}^2   =  \dot\g_1^2 + \dot\g_2^2 = (k^2 + 1) e^{2kt} \,.
$$
The arc-length starting from $t_0$ is
\begin{align}
s(t) & = \int_{t_0}^t \norm{\dot\g(\tau)} \, d \tau \\
     & = \sqrt{k^2 + 1} \int_{t_0}^t e^{k \tau} \, d \tau  \\
     & = \frac{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{k} ( e^t - e^{t_0} ) \,.

## Scalar product in $\R^n$

Let us start by defining the scalar product in $\R^2$. 

::: Definition
### Scalar product in $\R^2$

Let $u, v \in \R^2$ and denote by $\theta \in [0,\pi]$ the angle formed by $u$ and $v$. The *scalar product* between $u$ and $v$ is defined by 
$$
u \cdot v := |u| |v| \cos(\theta) \,. 
$$

:::


![Vectors $u$ and $v$ in $\R^2$ forming angle $\theta$](/images/scalar_product.png){width=60%}


::: Remark 

The scalar product is maximized for $\theta = 0$, for which we have
$$
u \cdot v := |u| |v| \cos(\theta) =  |u| |v| \,.
$$
It is instead minimized for $\theta = \pi$, for which 
$$
u \cdot v := |u| |v| \cos(\theta) =  -|u| |v| \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition 
### Orthogonal vectors

Let $u, v \in \R^2$. If 
$$
u \cdot v = 0
$$
we say that $u$ and $v$ are **orthogonal**.
:::




::: Proposition
### Bilinearity and symmetry of scalar product

Let $u, v, w \in \R^2$ and $\lambda \in \R$. Then

- $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$
- $\lambda (u \cdot v) = (\lambda u) \cdot v = u \cdot (\lambda v)$
- $u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v  + u \cdot w$


:::


We leave the proof to the reader. The above proposition is saying that the scalar product is **bilinear** and **symmetric**.


::: Proposition
### Scalar products written wrt euclidean coordinates

Denote by 
$$
e_1 = (1,0) \,, \quad e_2 = (0,1)
$$
the euclidean basis of $\R^2$. Let $u,v \in \R^2$ and denote by 
$$
u = (u_1,u_2) = u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2 
$$
$$
v = (v_1,v_2) = v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2 
$$
their coordinates with respect to $e_1,e_2$. Then
$$
u \cdot v = u_1v_2 + u_2 v_2 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof

Note that 
$$
e_1 \cdot e_1 = 1 \,, \quad e_2 \cdot e_2 = 1 \,, \quad 
e_1 \cdot e_2 = e_2 \cdot e_1 = 0 \,.
$$
Using the bilinearity of scalar product we have
\begin{align}
u \cdot v & = (u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2) \cdot (v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2) \\
          & = u_1 v_1 e_1 \cdot e_1 +  u_1 v_2 e_1 \cdot e_2 +
              u_2 v_1 e_2 \cdot e_1 + u_2 v_2  e_2 \cdot e_2 \\
          & = u_1 v_1  + u_2 v_2 \,.
\end{align}
:::




The above proposition provides a way to generalize of the scalar product to $\R^n$..

::: Definition
### Scalar product in $\R^n$

Let $u,v \in \R^n$ and denote their coordinates by
$$
u = (u_1, \ldots, u_n) \,, \quad
u = (v_1, \ldots, v_n) \,. 
$$
We define the scalar product between $u$ and $v$ by
$$
u \cdot v := \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i \,.
$$

::: Proposition
### Differentiating scalar product  {#proposition-diff-scalar}


Let $\gamma , \eta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be parametrized curves. Then the scalar map 
$$
\gamma \cdot \eta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R
$$
is smooth, and
$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\gamma \cdot \eta)  = \dot\g \cdot \eta + \g \cdot \dot \eta 
$$
for all $t \in (a,b)$.

:::


::: Proof

Denote by 
$$
\g = (\g_1 ,\ldots , \g_n) \,, \quad \eta = (\eta_1, \ldots , \eta_n)
$$
the coordinates of $\g$ and $\eta$. Clearly the map
$$
t \mapsto \g \cdot \eta = \sum_{i=1}^n \g_i \eta_i
$$
is smooth, being sum and product of smooth functions.  
Concerning the formula, by definition of scalar product and linearity of the derivative we have
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} (\gamma \cdot \eta) & = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \g_i \eta_i \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d}{dt} ( \g_i \eta_i ) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n  \dot\g_i \eta_i + \g_i \dot\eta_i \\
& = \dot\g \cdot \eta + \g \cdot \dot\eta \,,
\end{align}
where in the second to last equality we used the product rule of differentiation.

## Speed of a curve

Given a curve $\g$ we defined the **tangent** vector at $\g(t)$ to be
$$
\dot \g (t) \,.
$$
The tangent vector measures the change of direction of the curve. Therefore the magnitude of $\dot \g$ can be interpreted as the **speed** of the curve.

::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a curve. We define the speed of $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$ by
$$
\norm{\dot \g (t)} \,.
$$
We say that $\g$ is a **unit-speed** curve if
$$
\norm{\dot \g (t)}  = 1 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

The derivative of the arc-length $s$ gives the speed of $\g$: 
$$
s(t) := \int_{t_0}^t \norm{  \dot\g (\tau) } \, d\tau  \,\, \implies \,\,
\dot s(t) = \norm{  \dot\g (t) } \,.
$$

:::



The reason why we introduce unit speed curves is because they make calculations easy. This is essentially because of the next proposition.


::: Proposition
Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a unit speed curve. Then
$$
\dot \g \cdot \ddot \g = 0 
$$
for all $t \in (a,b)$.
