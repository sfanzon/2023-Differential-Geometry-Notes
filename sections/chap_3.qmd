# Parametrized curves

Let us recall the definition of **parametrized curve**.


::: Definition
### Parametrized curve

A **parametrized curve** in $\R^n$ is a function 
$$
\gamma \ \colon  (a,b) \to \R^n \,.
$$
where

$$
(a,b) = \{ t \in \R \ \colon \ a < t < b \} \,,
$$
with
$$
- \infty \leq a < b \leq \infty \,.
$$
The **components** of $\gamma(t) \in \R^n$ are denoted by 
$$
\gamma(t) = ( \gamma_1(t), \ldots, \gamma_n(t) ) \,,
$$
where the components are functions
$$
\gamma_i \ \colon (a,b) \to \R \,, 
$$
for all $i = 1, \ldots, n$.
:::


As we already mentioned, the aim of the course is to study curves by **differentiating** them. Let us see what that means for curves.

::: Definition
### Smooth functions

A scalar function $f \ \colon (a,b) \to \R$ is called **smooth** if the derivative
$$
\frac{d^n f}{dt^n}
$$
exists for all $n \geq 1$ and $t \in (a,b)$. 
:::

We will denote the first and second derivatives of $f$ as follows:
$$
\dot f :=  \frac{d f}{dt} \,, \quad  \ddot f := \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2} \,.
$$


::: Example
The function $f(x)=x^4$ is smooth, with
\begin{align}
& \frac{d f}{dt}  = 4x^3 ,\,\, \frac{d^2 f}{dt^2}  = 12 x^2 \,, \\
& \frac{d^3 f}{dt^3}  = 24 x ,\,\, \frac{d^4 f}{dt^4} = 24  \,, \\
& \frac{d^n f}{dt^n}  = 0  \, \text{ for all } \, n \geq 5  \,.
\end{align}
Other examples smooth functions are polynomials, as well as
$$
f(t) = \cos(t) , \,\, f(t) = \sin(t) \,, \,\, f(t) = e^t \,.
$$
:::


::: Definition 

Let $\gamma \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ with 
$$
\g(t) = ( \g_1(t), \ldots, \g_n(t) ) 
$$
be a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **smooth** if the components
$$
\g_i \ \colon (a,b) \to \R
$$
are smooth for all $i=1,\ldots,n$. The derivatives of $\g$ are 
$$
\frac{d^k\gamma}{dt^k}  := \left(  \frac{d^k\gamma_1}{dt^k} , \ldots, \frac{d^k\gamma_n}{dt^k} \right)  
$$
for all $k \in \N$. As a shorthand, we will denote the first derivative of $\g$ as 
$$
\dot \g := \frac{d\gamma}{dt} = \left(  \frac{d\gamma_1}{dt} , \ldots, \frac{d\gamma_n}{dt} \right)  
$$
and the second by
$$
\ddot \g := \frac{d^2\gamma}{dt^2} = \left(  \frac{d^2\gamma_1}{dt^2} , \ldots, \frac{d^2\gamma_n}{dt^2} \right)   \,.
$$
:::

In @fig-smooth-curve we skectch a smooth and a non-smooth curve. Notice that the curve on the right is smooth, except for the point $x$.


![Example of smooth and non-smooth curves](/images/smooth_curve.png){#fig-smooth-curve width=70%}


We will work under the following assumption.

::: {.Assumption .unnumbered}

All the parametrized curves in this lecture notes are assumed to be **smooth**.

:::


::: Example

The circle 
$$
\g (t) = (\cos(t),\sin(t))
$$
is a smooth parametrized curve, since both $\cos(t)$ and $\sin(t)$ are smooth functions. We have
$$
\dot \g = (-\sin(t),\cos(t)) \,.
$$
For example the derivative of $\g$ at the point $(0,1)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g( \pi/2) = (-\sin(\pi/2),\cos(\pi/2)) = (-1,0) \,.
$$
The plot of the circle and the derivative vector at $(-1,0)$ can be seen in @fig-circle-tangent.

## Tangent vectors


Looking at @fig-circle-tangent, it seems like the vector 
$$
\dot \g(\pi/2) = (-1,0)
$$
is **tangent** to the circle at the point
$$
\g(\pi/2) = (0,1) \,.
$$
Is this a coincidence? Not that all. Let us look at the definition of derivative at a point:
$$
\dot \g (t) := \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta} \,.
$$
If we just look at the quantity
$$
\frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta} 
$$
for non-negative $\delta$, we see that this vector is parallel to the chord joining $\g(t)$ to $\g(t + \delta)$, as shown in @fig-tangent below. As $\delta \to 0$, the length of the chord tends to zero. However the **direction** of the chord becomes **parallel** to that of the tangent vector of the curve $\g$ at $\g(t)$. Since 
$$
\frac{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}{\delta}  \to \dot \g(t)
$$
as $\delta \to 0$, we see that $\dot \g (t)$ is **parallel** to the tangent of $\g$ at $\g(t)$, as showin in @fig-tangent.


![Approximating the tangent vector](/images/tangent.png){#fig-tangent width=70%}



The above remark motivates the following definition. 

::: Definition
### Tangent vector {#definition-tangent}

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. The tangent vector to $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$ is defined as 
$$
\tau:= \dot \g(t) \,.
$$
:::



::: Example
### Tangent vector to helix

The helix is described by the parametric curve 
$$
\g \ \colon \R \to \R^3
$$
with
$$
\g_1(t) = \cos (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_2(t) = \sin (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_3(t) = t . 
$$
This is plotted in @fig-helix-tangent below. The tangent vector at point $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g (t) = ( -\sin(t), \cos(t) , 1) \,.
$$
For example in @fig-helix-tangent we plot the tangent vector at time $t = \pi/2$, that is,
$$
\dot\g(\pi/2) = (-1,0,\pi/2) \,. 
$$
The above looks very similar to the tangent vector to the circle. Except that there is a $z$ component, and that component is constant and equal to $1$. Intuitively this means that the helix is *lifting* from the plane $xy$ with constant speed with respect to the $z$-axis. We will soon give a name to this concept.

::: Remark
### Avoiding potential ambiguities

Sometimes it will happen that a curve self intersects, meaning that there are two time instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ and a point $p \in \R^n$ such that
$$
p = \g(t_1) = \g(t_2)\,.
$$
In this case there is ambiguity in talking about the tangent vector at the point $p$: in principle there are two tangent vectors $\dot\g(t_1)$ and  $\dot\g(t_2)$, and it could happen that 
$$
 \dot\g(t_1) \neq  \dot\g(t_1)\,.
$$
Thus the concept of tangent at $p$ is not well-defined. 
We need then to be more precise and talk about tangent at a certain **time-step** $t$, rather than at some **point** $p$. We however do not amend Definition \ref{definition-tangent}, but you should keep this potential ambiguity in mind.
:::


::: Example
### The Lemniscate, a self intersecting curve

For example consider $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined as
$$
\g_1(t) = \sin (t)\, ,  \,\,
\g_2(t) = \sin (t) \cos(t) \, .
$$
Such curve is called **Lemniscate**, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemniscate), and is plotted in @fig-eight below. The orgin $(0,0)$ is a point of self-intersection, meaning that 
$$
\g (0) = \g (\pi) = (0,0) \,.
$$
The tangent vector at point $\g(t)$ is given by
$$
\dot \g(t) = (\cos(t), \cos^2(t) - \sin^2(t) )
$$
and therefore we have two tangents at $(0,0)$, that is,
$$
\tau_1 = \dot\g(0) = (1,1) \,, \,\,
\tau_2 = \dot\g(\pi) = (-1,1) \,.
$$

## Length of curves


For a vector $v \in \R^n$ with components 
$$
v=(v_1,\ldots,v_n),
$$
its **length** is defined by
$$
\norm{v}:= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2 } \,.
$$
The above is just an extension of the Pythagoras theorem to $\R^n$, and the length of $v$ is computed from the origin.


![Interpretation of $\norm{v}$ in $\R^2$](/images/pythagoras.png){width=70%}


If we have a second vector $u \in \R^n$, then the quantity 
$$
\norm{u-v}:= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (u_i-v_i)^2 } 
$$
measures the length of the difference between $u$ and $v$.


![Interpretation of $\norm{u-v}$ in $\R^2$](/images/length_difference.png){width=70%}


We would like to define the concept of **length** of a curve. Intuitively, one could proceed by approximation as in the figure below.

![Approximating the length of $\g$](/images/length_approx.png){width=70%}

In formulae, this means choosing some time instants
$$
t_0, \ldots, t_m \in (a,b) \,.
$$
The length of the segment connecting $\g(t_{i-1})$ to $\g(t_i)$ is given by 
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.
$$
Thus 
$$
L(\g) \approx \sum_{i=1}^m \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.  
$$ {#eq-approx-length}
Intuitively, if we increase the number of points $t_i$, the quantity on the RHS of (@eq-approx-length) should approximate $L(\g)$ better and better. Let us make this precise.



::: Definition
### Partition

Let $(a,b)$ be an interval. A partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $[a,b]$ is a vector of time instants
$$
\mathcal{P} = (t_0,\ldots, t_k) \in [a,b]^{m+1}
$$
with 
$$
t_0 = a < t_1 < \ldots < t_{m-1} < t_m = b \,.
$$
If $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$, we define its maximum length as
$$
\norm{\mathcal{P}} := \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} |t_{i} - t_{i-1}| \,.
$$
:::

Note that $\norm{\mathcal{P}}$ measures how fine the partition $\mathcal{P}$ is.





::: Definition
### Length of approximating polygonal curve

Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve and $\mathcal{P}$ a partition of $[a,b]$. We define the length of the polygonal curve connecting the points
$$
\g(t_0)\,, \,\, \g(t_1) \,,  \,\, \ldots, \,\, \g(t_m)
$$
as
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P}) := \sum_{i=1}^m \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \,.
$$
:::


If $\norm{\mathcal{P}}$ becomes smaller and smaller, that is, the partition $\mathcal{P}$ is finer and finer, it is reasonable to say that 
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P})
$$
is approximating the length of $\g$. We take this as definition of length.


::: Definition
### Rectifiable curve and length

Suppose $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **rectifiable** if the limit
$$
L(\g) = \lim_{ \norm{P} \to 0}   \ L(\g,\mathcal{P})
$$
exists finite. In such case we call $L(\g)$ the **length** of $\gamma$.
:::


This definition definitely corresponds to our geometrical intuition of length of a curve. 

::: Question
How do we use such definition in practice to compute the length of a given curve $\g$?
:::

Thankfully, when $\g$ is smooth, the length $L(\g)$ can be characterized in terms of $\dot\g$. Indeed, when $\delta$ is small, then the quantity 
$$
\norm{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}
$$
is approximating the length of $\g$ between $\g(t)$ and $\g(t + \delta)$. Multiplying and dividing by $\delta$ we obtain
$$
\frac{\norm{\g(t + \delta) - \g(t)}}{\delta} \, \delta 
$$
which for small $\delta$ is close to 
$$
\norm{\dot\g(t)} \,\delta \,.
$$
We can now divide the time interval $(a,b)$ in steps $t_0, \ldots, t_m$ with $|t_{i}-t_{i-1}| < \delta$ and obtain 
\begin{align}
\norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1}) } & = \frac{\norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1})}}{ |t_{i}-t_{i-1}| } |t_{i}-t_{i-1}| \\
& \approx \norm{ \dot\g(t_i)} \delta 
\end{align}
since $\delta$ is small. Therefore
$$
L(\g) \approx \sum_{i=1}^m  \norm{\g(t_{i}) - \g(t_{i-1})} 
\approx \sum_{i=1}^m   \norm{\dot\g(t_i)} \,\delta \,.
$$
The RHS is a Riemann sum, therefore 
$$
  L(\g) \approx \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \,.
$$

The above argument can be made rigorous, as we see in the next theorem.


![Approximating $L(\g)$ via $\dot\g$](/images/length_derivative.png){width=70%}




::: Theorem
### Characterizing the length of $\g$  {#theorem-length}

Assume $\g \ \colon [a,b] \to \R^n$ is a parametrized curve, with $[a,b]$ bounded. Then $\g$ is rectifiable and
$$
L(\g) = \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \,. 
$$ {#eq-length-formula}

:::

::: Proof

*Step 1. The integral in (@eq-length-formula) is bounded.*  
Since $\g$ is smooth, in particular $\dot \g$ is continuous. Since $[a,b]$ is bounded, then $\dot \g$ is bounded, that is 
$$
\sup_{t \in [a,b]} \norm{\dot \g(t)} \leq C
$$
for some constant $C \geq 0$. Therefore 
$$
\int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt \leq C (b-a) < \infty \,.
$$

*Step 2. Writing (@eq-length-formula) as limit.*  
Recalling that 
$$
L(\g) = \lim_{\norm{\mathcal{P}} \to 0} \ L(\g,\mathcal{P}) \,,
$$
whenever the limit is finite, in order to show (@eq-length-formula)  we then need to prove
$$
L(\g,\mathcal{P}) \to \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt
$$
as $\norm{\mathcal{P}} \to 0$. Showing the above means proving that: for every $\e > 0$ there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that, if $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition of $[a,b]$ such that $\norm{ \mathcal{P} }<\delta$, then 
$$
\left|    \int_a^b  \norm{\dot\g(t)} \, dt -  L(\g , \mathcal{P} )        \right| < \e \,.
$${#eq-length-formula-1}


*Step 3. First estimate in (@eq-length-formula-1).*  
This first estimate is easy, and only relies on the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. To be more precise, we will show that each polygonal has shorter length than $\int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt$. To this end, take an arbitrary partition $\mathcal{P} = (t_0, \ldots, t_m)$ of $[a,b]$. Then for each $i = 1,\ldots,m$ we have
$$
\norm{  \g(t_i) - \g (t_{i-1}) } = \norm{  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i}  \dot\g (t)\, dt } \leq   \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i}\norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt   
$$
where we used the Fundamental Theorem of calculus, and usual integral properties. Therefore by definition
\begin{align}
L(\g,\mathcal{P} ) & = \sum_{i=1}^m  \norm{  \g(t_i) - \g (t_{i-1}) } \\ 
& \leq \sum_{i=1}^m  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_i} \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt \\
& = \int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt \,.
\end{align}
We have then shown 
$$
L(\g, \mathcal{P}) \leq \int_{a}^b \norm{   \dot\g (t)} \, dt
$${#eq-length-formula-2}
for all partitions $\mathcal{P}$.  


*Step 4. Second estimate in (@eq-length-formula-1).*  
The second estimate is more delicate. We need to carefully construct a polygonal so that its length is close to $\int_a^b \norm{ \dot \g} \,dt$. This will be possible by uniform continuity of $\dot\g$. Indeed, note that $\dot \g$ is continuous on the compact set $[a,b]$. Therefore it is uniformly continuous by the Heine-Borel Theorem. Fix $\e>0$. By uniform continuity of $\dot \g$ there exists $\delta >0$ such that
$$
|t-s| < \delta \implies \norm{ \dot\g(t)-\dot\g(s) } < \frac{ \e }{b-a} \,.
$$ {#eq-length-formula-uc}
for all $t,s \in [a,b]$. Let $\mathcal{P} = (t_0, \ldots, t_m)$ be a partition of $[a,b]$ with $\norm{\mathcal{P}} < \delta$. Recall that 
$$
\norm{\mathcal{P}} = \max_{i=1,\ldots ,m} |t_i - t_{i-1}| \,.
$$
Therefore the condition  $\norm{\mathcal{P}} < \delta$ implies 
$$
|t_i - t_{i-1}| < \delta 
$$ {#eq-length-formula-3}
for each $i = 1, \ldots, m$. For all $i = 1, \ldots, m$ and $s \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$ we have
\begin{align}
\g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) & = \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }  \dot\g(t)\, dt \\
                      & =  \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i } \dot\g(s) +  (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt \\
                      & = ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \dot\g(s) + \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt
\end{align}
Therefore
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  = \norm{ ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \dot\g(s) + 
 \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
$${#eq-length-formula-4}
We can now use the reverse triangle inequality
$$
| \| x\| - \norm{y}| \leq \norm{x-y}\,, 
$$
for all $x,y \in \R^n$, which implies
$$
 \norm{x+y}  = \norm{x - (-y)} \geq \| x \| - \norm{y}
$$
for all $x,y \in \R^n$. Applying the above to (@eq-length-formula-4) we get
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  \geq
 ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)} - 
\norm{ \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
$${#eq-length-formula-5}
By standard properties of integral we also have
$$
\norm{ \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   (\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s))    \, dt }
\leq 
\int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt\,,
$$
so that (@eq-length-formula-5) implies
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } \geq ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)}   - \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt\,.
$${#eq-length-formula-6}
Since $t,s \in [t_{i-1},t_i]$, then 
$$
|t-s| \leq | t_{i} - t_{i-1} |   <  \delta
$$ 
where the last inequality follows by (@eq-length-formula-3). Thus by uniform continuity (@eq-length-formula-uc) we get
$$
\norm{ \dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s) } < \frac{\e}{b-a} \,.
$$
We can therefore further estimate (@eq-length-formula-6) and obtain
\begin{align}
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } & \geq ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)}   - \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i }   \norm{\dot\g(t) - \dot\g(s)}    \, dt \\
& \geq  ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \norm{\dot\g(s)} -  ( t_i - t_{i-1} ) \frac{\e}{b-a}    \, dt \,.
\end{align}
Dividing the above by $t_i - t_{i-1}$ we get
$$
\frac{ \norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) } }{ t_i - t_{i-1}  } \geq
 \norm{\dot\g(s)} - \frac{\e}{b-a}  \,.
$$
Integrating the above over $s$ in the interval $[t_{i-1}, t_i ]$ we get
$$
\norm{ \g(t_i) - \g(t_{i-1}) }  \geq \int_{t_{i-1}}^{ t_i } \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds  - \frac{\e}{b-a} (t_i - t_{i-1}) \,.
$$
Summing over $i=1,\ldots,m$ we get
$$
L(\mathcal{P},\g) \geq \int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds - \e
$$ {#eq-length-formula-7}
since
$$
\sum_{i=1}^m (t_i - t_{i-1}) = t_m - t_0 = b - a \,. 
$$

*Conclusion.*    
Putting together (@eq-length-formula-2) and (@eq-length-formula-7) we get 
$$
\int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds - \e   \leq L(\mathcal{P},\g) 
\leq  \int_{a}^b \norm{\dot\g(s)} \, ds
$$
which implies (@eq-length-formula-1), concluding the proof.
:::


Thanks to the above theorem we have now a way to compute $L(\g)$. 
Let us check that we have given a meaningful definition of length by computing $L(\g)$ on known examples.



::: Example
### Length of Circle

The circle of radius $R$ is parametrized by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t))
$$
and 
\begin{align}
\norm{\dot\g(t)} & = \sqrt{ \dot \g_1^2(t) +   \dot \g_2^2(t)      } \\
                & = R \sqrt{ \sin^2(t) + \cos^2 (t)} = R\,.
\end{align}
Therefore 
$$
L(\g) = \int_{0}^{2\pi}  \norm{  \dot\g(t)} \, dt = \int_0^{2\pi} R \, dt = 2 \pi R
$$
as expected.
:::




::: Example
### Length of helix

Let us consider one full turn of the Helix of radius $R$ and rise $H$. This is parametrized by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t) ,Ht)
$$
for $t \in [0,2\pi]$. Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t) , H) \,,
$$
and 
\begin{align}
\norm{ \dot \g(t)  } & = \sqrt{  \dot\g_1^2 + \dot\g_2^2 + \dot\g_3^2 } \\
                    & = \sqrt{ R^2\sin^2(t) + R^2\cos^2(t) + H^2 } = \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,.
\end{align}
Therefore 
$$
L(\g) = \int_0^{2\pi} \norm{ \dot\g(t) } \, dt = 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2 + H^2} \,. 
$$
:::





## Arc-length

We have just shown in Theorem \ref{theorem-length} that the length of a regular curve $\g \ \colon [a,b] \to \R^n$ with $[a,b]$ bounded is given by
$$
L(\g) = \int_a^b \norm{ \dot\g (t)} \,dt \,.
$$
Using this formula, we introduce the notion of length of a portion of $\g$.




::: Definition
### Arc-length

Let $\g \, \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a curve, with $(a,b)$ possibly unbounded. We define the **arc-length** of $\g$ starting at the point $\g(t_0)$ as the function $s \colon \R \to \R$ defined by
$$
s(t) := \int_{t_0}^t  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau) }\, d\tau \,.
$$

:::


![Arc-length of $\g$ starting at $\g(t_0)$](/images/arc_length.png){width=70%}


::: Remark

A few remarks:

- Arc-length is well-defined 

     >Indeed, $\g$ is smooth, and so $\dot \g$ is continuous. WLOG assume $t \geq t_0$. Then
     $$
     s(t) = \int_{t_0}^t  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau) }\, d\tau \leq (t-t_0) \max_{ \tau \in [t_0,t] } \norm{\dot\g(\tau)} < \infty \,.
     $$

- We always have
$$
s(t_0)=0\,.
$$

- We have
$$
t > t_0   \implies  s(t) \geq 0 
$$
and 
$$
t < t_0   \implies  s(t) \leq 0 \,.
$$

- Choosing a different starting point changes the arc-length by a **constant**: 

     >For example define $\tilde{s}$ as the arc-length starting from $\tilde{t}_0$
     $$
     \tilde{s}(t) := \int_{\tilde{t}_0}^t \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau  \,.
     $$
     Then by the properties of integral
     \begin{align}
     s(t) & = \int_{t_0}^t \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \\
      & = \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau +
         \int_{\tilde{t}_0}^{t} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \\
      & = \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau + \tilde{s}(t) \,.
     \end{align}
     Hence 
     $$
     s = c + \tilde{s} 
     $$
     with 
     $$
     c := \int_{t_0}^{\tilde{t}_0} \norm{ \dot\g(\tau) } \, d\tau \,.
     $$
     Note that $c$ is the arc-length of $\g$ between the starting points $\g(t_0)$ and $\g(\tilde{t}_0)$.

- The arc-length is a differentiable function, with
$$
\dot s(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \int_{t_0}^t \norm{\dot\g (\tau)} \, d\tau =
 \norm{\dot\g (t)} \,.
$$
     
     >Since $\dot\g$ is continuous, the above follows by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

::: Example
### Circle

The circle of radius $R$ is parametrized by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined by 
$$
\g(t) = (R\cos(t), R\sin(t)) \,.
$$
Then 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (-R\sin(t), R\cos(t)) \,, \quad \norm{\dot\g(t)} = R \,.
$$
Therefore, for any fixed $t_0 \in [0,2\pi]$ we have
$$
s(t) = \int_{t_0}^{t}  \norm{  \dot\g(\tau)} \, d\tau = \int_{t_0}^{t} R \, d\tau = (t - t_0)  R \,.
$$
In particular we see that $\dot s = R$ is constant.
:::


::: Example
### Logarithmic spiral

The Logarithmic spiral is defined by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ with
$$
\g(t) = (e^{kt} \cos(t), e^{kt} \sin(t)) \,,
$$
where $k \in \R$, $k \neq 0$, is called the **growth factor**.
Then 
$$
\dot \g_1(t) = e^{kt} ( k \cos(t) - \sin(t) )
$$
$$ 
\dot \g_2(t) = e^{kt} ( k \sin(t) + \cos(t) ) 
$$
and so, after some calculations,
$$
\norm{\dot\g(t)}^2   =  \dot\g_1^2 + \dot\g_2^2 = (k^2 + 1) e^{2kt} \,.
$$
The arc-length starting from $t_0$ is
\begin{align}
s(t) & = \int_{t_0}^t \norm{\dot\g(\tau)} \, d \tau \\
     & = \sqrt{k^2 + 1} \int_{t_0}^t e^{k \tau} \, d \tau  \\
     & = \frac{\sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{k} ( e^{kt} - e^{k t_0} ) \,.

## Scalar product in $\R^n$

Let us start by defining the scalar product in $\R^2$. 

::: Definition
### Scalar product in $\R^2$

Let $u, v \in \R^2$ and denote by $\theta \in [0,\pi]$ the angle formed by $u$ and $v$. The *scalar product* between $u$ and $v$ is defined by 
$$
u \cdot v := |u| |v| \cos(\theta) \,. 
$$

:::


![Vectors $u$ and $v$ in $\R^2$ forming angle $\theta$](/images/scalar_product.png){width=60%}


::: Remark 

The scalar product is maximized for $\theta = 0$, for which we have
$$
u \cdot v = |u| |v| \cos(\theta) =  |u| |v| \,.
$$
It is instead minimized for $\theta = \pi$, for which 
$$
u \cdot v = |u| |v| \cos(\theta) =  -|u| |v| \,.
$$
:::



::: Definition 
### Orthogonal vectors

Let $u, v \in \R^2$. If 
$$
u \cdot v = 0
$$
we say that $u$ and $v$ are **orthogonal**.
:::




::: Proposition
### Bilinearity and symmetry of scalar product

Let $u, v, w \in \R^2$ and $\lambda \in \R$. Then

- **Symmetry**: $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$
- **Bilinearity**: It holds
$$
\lambda (u \cdot v) = (\lambda u) \cdot v = u \cdot (\lambda v) \,,
$$
$$
u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v  + u \cdot w \,.
$$

:::


We leave the proof to the reader. The above proposition is saying that the scalar product is **bilinear** and **symmetric**.


::: Proposition
### Scalar products written wrt euclidean coordinates

Denote by 
$$
e_1 = (1,0) \,, \quad e_2 = (0,1)
$$
the euclidean basis of $\R^2$. Let $u,v \in \R^2$ and denote by 
$$
u = (u_1,u_2) = u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2 
$$
$$
v = (v_1,v_2) = v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2 
$$
their coordinates with respect to $e_1,e_2$. Then
$$
u \cdot v = u_1v_2 + u_2 v_2 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof

Note that 
$$
e_1 \cdot e_1 = 1 \,, \quad e_2 \cdot e_2 = 1 \,, \quad 
e_1 \cdot e_2 = e_2 \cdot e_1 = 0 \,.
$$
Using the bilinearity of scalar product we have
\begin{align}
u \cdot v & = (u_1 e_1 + u_2 e_2) \cdot (v_1 e_1 + v_2 e_2) \\
          & = u_1 v_1 e_1 \cdot e_1 +  u_1 v_2 e_1 \cdot e_2 +
              u_2 v_1 e_2 \cdot e_1 + u_2 v_2  e_2 \cdot e_2 \\
          & = u_1 v_1  + u_2 v_2 \,.
\end{align}
:::




The above proposition provides a way to generalize of the scalar product to $\R^n$..

::: Definition
### Scalar product in $\R^n$

Let $u,v \in \R^n$ and denote their coordinates by
$$
u = (u_1, \ldots, u_n) \,, \quad
u = (v_1, \ldots, v_n) \,. 
$$
We define the scalar product between $u$ and $v$ by
$$
u \cdot v := \sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i \,.
$$


:::


With the above definition we still have that the scalar product is bilinear and symmetric, as detailed in the following proposition:

::: Proposition
### Bilinearity and symmetry of scalar product in $\R^n$

Let $u, v, w \in \R^n$ and $\lambda \in \R$. Then

- **Symmetry**: $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$
- **Bilinearity**: It holds
$$
\lambda (u \cdot v) = (\lambda u) \cdot v = u \cdot (\lambda v) \,,
$$
$$
u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v  + u \cdot w \,.
$$

:::


The proof of the above proposition is an easy check, and is left to the reader for exercise.


::: Definition

Let $u,v \in \R^n$. We say that $u$ and $v$ are **orthogonal** if 
$$
u \cdot v = 0 \,.
$$

:::



::: Proposition
### Differentiating scalar product  {#proposition-diff-scalar}


Let $\gamma , \eta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be parametrized curves. Then the scalar map 
$$
\gamma \cdot \eta \ \colon (a,b) \to \R
$$
is smooth, and
$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\gamma \cdot \eta)  = \dot\g \cdot \eta + \g \cdot \dot \eta 
$$
for all $t \in (a,b)$.

:::


::: Proof

Denote by 
$$
\g = (\g_1 ,\ldots , \g_n) \,, \quad \eta = (\eta_1, \ldots , \eta_n)
$$
the coordinates of $\g$ and $\eta$. Clearly the map
$$
t \mapsto \g \cdot \eta = \sum_{i=1}^n \g_i \eta_i
$$
is smooth, being sum and product of smooth functions.  
Concerning the formula, by definition of scalar product and linearity of the derivative we have
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} (\gamma \cdot \eta) & = \frac{d}{dt} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \g_i \eta_i \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{d}{dt} ( \g_i \eta_i ) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^n  \dot\g_i \eta_i + \g_i \dot\eta_i \\
& = \dot\g \cdot \eta + \g \cdot \dot\eta \,,
\end{align}
where in the second to last equality we used the product rule of differentiation.

## Speed of a curve

Given a curve $\g$ we defined the **tangent** vector at $\g(t)$ to be
$$
\dot \g (t) \,.
$$
The tangent vector measures the change of direction of the curve. Therefore the magnitude of $\dot \g$ can be interpreted as the **speed** of the curve.

::: Definition

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a curve. We define the speed of $\g$ at the point $\g(t)$ by
$$
\norm{\dot \g (t)} \,.
$$
We say that $\g$ is a **unit-speed** curve if
$$
\norm{\dot \g (t)}  = 1 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::


::: Remark

The derivative of the arc-length $s$ gives the speed of $\g$: 
$$
s(t) := \int_{t_0}^t \norm{  \dot\g (\tau) } \, d\tau  \,\, \implies \,\,
\dot s(t) = \norm{  \dot\g (t) } \,.
$$

:::



The reason why we introduce unit speed curves is because they make calculations easy. This is essentially because of the next proposition.


::: { .Proposition #proposition-speed-identity} 

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a unit speed curve. Then
$$
\dot \g \cdot \ddot \g = 0 
$$
for all $t \in (a,b)$.
:::


::: Proof
Let us consider the identity
$$
\dot \g(t) \cdot \dot \g(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \dot\g_i^2(t) = \norm{\dot\g(t)}^2 \,.
$$ {#eq-speed-identity}
Since $\g$ is unit speed we have
$$
\norm{\dot\g(t)}^2 = 1 \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
and therefore
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \norm{\dot\g(t)}^2 \right) = 0  \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,. 
$$ {#eq-speed-identity-1}
We can differentiate the LHS of (@eq-speed-identity) to get
$$
\frac{d}{dt} (\dot \g \cdot \dot \g) = \ddot \g \cdot \dot \g
+  \dot \g \cdot \ddot \g = 2 \dot \g \cdot \ddot \g\,.
$${#eq-speed-identity-2}
where we used Proposition \ref{proposition-diff-scalar} and symmetry of the scalar product. Differentiating (@eq-speed-identity) and using (@eq-speed-identity-1)-(@eq-speed-identity-2)  we conclude
$$
2 \dot \g \cdot \ddot \g = 0 \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
:::




::: Remark

Proposition \ref{proposition-speed-identity} is saying that if $\g$ is unit speed, then its tangent vector $\dot \g$ is always orthogonal to the second derivative $\ddot \g$. This will be very useful in the future.

## Reparametrization

As we have observed in the Examples of @sec-introduction, there is in general no unique way to parametrize a curve. However we would like to understand when two parametrizations are related. In other words, we want to clarify the concept of **equivalence** of two parametrizations. 



::: Definition
### Diffeomorphism

Let $\f \ \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$. We say that $\f$ is a **diffeomorphism** if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. $\f$ is invertible, with inverse $\f^{-1} \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)$. Thus
$$
\f^{-1} \circ \f =   \f \circ \f^{-1} = \id \,,
$$
where $\id \colon \R \to \R$ is the identity map on $\R$, that is, 
$$
\id(t) = t \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
2. $\f$ is smooth,
2.  $\f^{-1}$ is smooth.

::: 



::: Definition
### Reparametrization

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. A **reparametrization** of $\g$ is another parametrized curve $\tilde{\g} \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R^n$ such that
$$
\tg (t) = \g (\f(t)) \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})\,, 
$$ {#eq-reparametrization}
where 
$$
\f \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)
$$
is a diffeomerphism. We call both $\f$ and $\f^{-1}$  **reparametrization maps**.
:::

::: Remark
A comment about the above definition.
Given a parametrized curve $\g$, this identifies a 1D shape $\Gamma \subset \R^n$. A reparametrization $\tg$ is just an equivalent way to describe $\Gamma$. For $\g$ and $\tg$ to be reparametrizations of each other, there must exist a smooth rule $\f$ to switch from one to another, according to formula (@eq-reparametrization) 
:::

::: Example
### Change of orientation

The map $\f \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)$ defined by 
$$
\f (t) := - t 
$$
is a diffeomoprhism. The inverse of $\f$ is given by ${\f}^{-1} \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$ defined by
$$
{\f}^{-1} (t) = - t \,.
$$
Note that $\f$ can be used to **reverse the orientation** of a curve.
:::


::: Example
### Reversing orientation of circle

Consider the unit circle parametrized as usual by $\g \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to \R^2$ defined as
$$
\g (t) := (\cos (t), \sin(t)) \,.
$$
To reverse the orientation we can reparametrize $\g$ by using the diffeomorphism
$$
\f(t):= - t \,.
$$
This way we obtain $\tilde{\g}:= \g \circ \f \ \colon [0,2\pi] \to [0, 2\pi]$, 
\begin{align}
\tilde{\g}(t) & = \g (\f(t)) \\
              & = (\cos(-t),\sin(-t)) \\
              & = (\cos(t),-\sin(t)) \,,
\end{align}
where in the last identity we used the properties of $\cos$ and $\sin$. Notice that in this way, for example,
$$
\g(\pi/2) = (0,1) \,, \quad \g(\pi/2) = (0,-1) \,. 
$$

### Doubling the speed of Lemniscate

Recall the Lemniscate
$$
\g (t): = (\sin(t), \sin(t)\cos(t) ) \,, \quad t \in [0,2\pi] \,.
$$
We can double the speed of the Lemniscate by using the Using the diffeomorphism 
$$
\f(t):=2t \,.
$$
This way we obtain $\tilde{\g}:= \g \circ \f \ \colon [0,\pi] \to [0, 2\pi]$ with
$$
\tg (t) = \g (\f(t)) = (\sin(2t), \sin(2t)\cos(2t)) \,. 
$$
In this case we have that 
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) = 2 \dot \g(\f(t)) \,.
$$

> The above follows by chain rule. Indeed, $\dot\f = 2$, so that

The main reason we are interested in reparametrizations is because we want to parametrize curves by **arc-lenght**: This means that, for a curve $\g$, we want to find a reparametrization $\tg$ such that $\tg$ is unit speed:
$$
\norm{ \dot{\tg} } = 1 \,, \quad  \forall t \in (a,b) \,.

We will see that this is not always possible.

### Regular points

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. We say that:

- $\g(t_0)$ is a **regular point** if 
$$
\dot\g(t_0) \neq 0 \,.
$$
- A point $\g(t_0)$ is **singular** if it is not regular.
- The curve $\g$ is regular if every point of $\g$ is regular, that is,
$$
\dot\g(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,. 
$$

:::


Note that when $\dot\g(t_0) = 0$, this means the curve is *stopping* at time $t_0$. Before making an example, let us prove a useful lemma about diffeomorphisms.

::: {.Lemma  #lemma-diffeomorphism}

Let $\f \ \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$ be a diffeomorphism. Then 
$$
\dot\f (t) \neq 0 \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We know that $\f$ is smooth with smooth inverse 
$$
\psi := \f^{-1} \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b) \,.
$$
In particular it holds
$$
\psi (\f(t)) = t \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
We can differentiate both sides of the above expression to get
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \psi (\f(t))  \right) = 1 \,.
$$ {#eq-lemma-diffeomorphism-1}
We can differentiate the LHS by chain rule
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \psi (\f(t))  \right) = \dot\psi (\f(t)) \, \dot\f(t) \,.
$$
From (@eq-lemma-diffeomorphism-1) we then get
$$
 \dot\psi (\f(t)) \, \dot\f(t) = 1 \, , \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Since on the LHS we have a product, this means that none of the LHS terms vanishes, so that 
$$
\dot\f(t) \neq  0 \, , \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$

\g (t) = (t,t^2) \,, \quad 
\eta(t) = (t^3, t^6) \,.
$$
We will see that the above parametrizations are **not** equivalent. This is intuitively clear, since the change of variables map should be 
$$
\f(t) = t^3 \,.
$$
This is smooth and invertible, with inverse 
$$
\f^{-1}(t) = \sqrt[3]{x} \,.
$$
However $\f^{-1}$ is not smooth at $t=0$, and thus $\f$ is not a diffeomorphism. Alternatively we could have just noticed that 
$$
\dot \f (t) = 3t^2 \quad \implies \quad \dot\f(0) = 0 \,, 
$$
and therefore $\f$ cannot be a diffeomorphism due to Lemma \ref{lemma-diffeomorphism}.

Let us look at the derivatives:
$$
\dot \g (t) = (1,2t) \,, \quad \dot \eta (t)= (3t^2,6t^5) \,.
$$
We notice a difference:

- $\g$ is a regular parametrization,
- $\eta(t)$ is regular only for $t \neq 0$.

Indeed if we animate the plots of the above parametrizations, we see that:

- The point $\g(t)$ moves with constant horizontal speed
- The point $\eta(t)$ is decelerating for $t < 0$, it stops at $t = 0$, and then accelerates again for $t>0$.

::: Proposition
### Regularity is invariant for reparametrization  {#proposition-regularity-invariant}

Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve and suppose that $\g$ is regular, that is, 
$$
\dot\g(t) \neq 0 \,, \quad  \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Then every reparametrization of $\g$ is also regular.
:::


::: Proof

Let $\tg \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R^n$ be a reparametrization of $\g$. Then there exist $\f \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)$ diffeomorphism such that 
$$
\tilde \g (t) = \g (\f (t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$
By the chain rule we have 
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) = \frac{d}{dt}  \left(  \g (\f(t))  \right) = \dot\g (\f(t)) \dot\f(t) \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) \neq 0 \quad \iff \quad \dot\g (\f(t)) \dot\f(t)  \neq 0 \,.
$$ {#eq-regularity-invariant-1}
But we are assuming that $\g$ is regular, so that 
$$
\dot\g (\f(t)) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall\, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$
Thus (@eq-regularity-invariant-1) is equivalent to 
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) \neq 0 \quad \iff \quad  \dot\f(t)  \neq 0 \,.
$$ {#eq-regularity-invariant-2}
Since $\f$ is a diffeomorphism, by Lemma \ref{lemma-diffeomorphism} we have that 
$$
\dot \f (t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall\, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \,.
$$
By (@eq-regularity-invariant-2) we conclude that 
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) \neq  0 \, , \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,, 
$$
proving that $\tg$ is regular.
:::



::: Example 

Let us go back to the parabola
$$
\Gamma := \{ (x,y) \in \R^2 \, \colon \,  y=x^2 , \, -1 \leq x \leq 1\} \,,
$$
with the two parametrizations $\g, \eta \ \colon [-1,1] \to \R^2$ with
$$
\g (t) = (t,t^2) \,, \quad 
\eta(t) = (t^3, t^6) \,.
$$
We have that
$$
\dot \g (t) = (1,2t) \,, \quad \dot \eta (t)= (3t^2,6t^5) \,.
$$
Therefore 

- $\g$ is a regular parametrization,
- $\eta(t)$ is regular only for $t \neq 0$.

Proposition \ref{proposition-regularity-invariant} implies that $\eta$ is **NOT** a reparametrization of $\g$.

::: Definition 
### Unit speed reparametrization

Let $\g$ be a parametrized curve. A **unit speed reparametrization** of $\g$ is a reparametrization $\tg$ such that $\tg$ is unit speed.

:::


The next theorem states that a curve is regular if and only if it has a unit speed reparametrization. For the proof, it is crucial to recall the definition of arc-length of a curve $\g \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$, which is given by 
$$
s(t):=\int_{t_0}^t \norm{ \dot \g (\tau) } \, d\tau \,,
$$
for some arbitrary $t_0 \in (a,b)$ fixed. Indeed, we will see that for $\f$ regular the unit speed parametrization map can be taken as 
$$
\f = s^{-1} \,.
$$ 


::: Theorem
### Existence of unit speed reparametrization  {#theorem-regular-unit-speed}

Let $\g$ be a parametrized curve. They are equivalent:

- $\g$ is regular,
- $\g$ has a unit speed reparametrization.
:::


::: Proof

*Step 1. Direct implication.*  
Assume $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ is regular, that is,
$$
\dot \g (t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
Let $s \ \colon (a,b) \to \R$ be the arc-length of $\g$ starting at any point $t_0 \in (a,b)$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we have
$$
\dot s (t) = \norm{ \dot \g(t) }  
$$ {#eq-derivative-arc}
so that 
$$
\dot s (t) > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
Since $s$ is a scalar function, the above condition and the Inverse Function Theorem guarantee the existsence of a smooth inverse
$$
s^{-1} \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)
$$
for some $\tilde{\alpha}< \tilde{\beta}$. 
Define the reparametrization map $\f$ as
$$
\f := s^{-1}
$$
and the corresponding reparametrization of $\g$ given by the curve
$$
\tg \ \colon  (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R^n \,, \quad 
\tg := \g \circ \f \,. 
$$
We claim that $\tg$ is unit speed. Indeed, by definition
$$
\tg := \g \circ \f \quad \implies \quad \g = \tg \circ \f^{-1} = \tg \circ s \,,
$$
or in other words
$$
\g(t) = \tg (s(t)) \,, \quad \forall t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Differentiating the above expression and using the chain rule we get
$$
\dot \g (t) = \dot{\tg}(s(t)) \, \dot s(t) =  \dot{\tg}(s(t)) \, \norm{ \dot \g(t) }  
$$
where in the last equality we used (@eq-derivative-arc). Taking the absolute value of the above yileds
$$
 \norm{ \dot \g(t) }   = \norm{\dot{\tg}(s(t))} \, \norm{ \dot \g(t) } \,.  
$${#eq-derivative-arc-1}
Since $\g$ is regular, we have
$$
\norm{\dot \g (t)} \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
Therefore we can divide (@eq-derivative-arc-1) by $\norm{\dot\g(t)}$ and obtain
$$
\norm{\dot{\tg}(s(t))} = 1  \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
By invertibility of $s$, the above holds if and only if
$$
\norm{\dot{\tg}(t)} = 1  \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,,
$$
showing that $\tg$ is a unit speed reparametrization of $\g$.

*Step 2. Reverse implication.*  
Suppose there exists a unit speed reparametrization of $\g$ denoted by 
$$
\tg \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \to \R^n \,, \quad \tg = \g \circ \f
$$
for some reparametrization map $\f \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to (a,b)$. Differentiating $\tg = \g \circ \f$ and using the chain rule we get
$$
\dot{\tg}(t) = \dot{\g} (\f(t)) \, \dot \f(t) \,.
$$
Taking the norm
$$
\norm{\dot{\tg}(t)} = \norm{\dot{\g} (\f(t)) } \, |\dot \f (t)| \,.
$$
Since $\tg$ is unit speed we obtain
$$
\norm{\dot{\g} (\f(t)) } \, |\dot \f (t)| = 1 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$ {#eq-derivative-arc-3}
Since $\f$ is a diffeomorphism from $(\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$ into $(a,b)$, Lemma \ref{lemma-diffeomorphism} guarantees that
$$
\dot{\f} (t)  \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
In particular (@eq-derivative-arc-3) implies
$$
\dot{\g} (\f(t))  \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \,.
$$
As $\f$ is invertible, we also have
$$
\dot{\g} (t)  \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,,
$$
proving that $\g$ is regular.
:::


The proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-regular-unit-speed} told us that, if $\g$ is regular, then 
$$
\tg = \g \circ s^{-1} 
$$
is a unit speed reparametrization of $\g$. In the next proposition we show that the arc-length $s$ is essentially the only unit-speed reparametrization of a regular curve. 


::: Proposition
### Arc-length and unit speed reparametrization  {#proposition-arc-length-unit}
Let $\g \ \colon (a,b) \to \R^n$ be a regular curve. Let $\tg \ \colon (\tilde{a},\tilde{b}) \to \R^n$ be reparametrization of $\g$, so that
$$
\g(t) = \tg ( \f(t) )  , \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,.
$$
for some diffeomorphism $\f \ \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$. Denote by
$$
s(t):= \int_{t_0}^t  \norm{\dot\g(\tau)} \, d \tau \,, \quad t \in (a,b)
$$
the arc-length of $\g$ starting at any point $t_0 \in (a,b)$. We have:

1. If $\tg$ is unit speed, then there exists $c \in \R$ such that
$$
\f(t) = \pm s(t) + c   \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$ {#eq-proposition-unit-speed}

2. If $\f$ is given by (@eq-proposition-unit-speed) for some $c \in \R$, then $\tg$ is unit speed.

:::


::: Proof
*Step 1. First Point.*  
First note that a unit speed reparametrization $\tg$ of $\g$ exists by Theorem \ref{theorem-regular-unit-speed}, since $\g$ is assumed to be regular. Thus assume $\tg$ is unit speed reparametrization of $\g$.  By differentiating both sides of
$$
\g(t) = \tg ( \f(t) )  , \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)\,, 
$$
we obtain
$$
\dot \g(t) = \frac{d}{dt} \tg ( \f(t) ) = \dot{\tg}(\f(t)) \, \dot\f(t)  \,. 
$$
Taking the norms we then have
\begin{align}
\norm{ \dot \g(t) } & = \norm{ \dot{\tg}(\f(t)) \, \dot\f(t) } \\
                    & = \norm{ \dot{\tg}(\f(t)) } \, | \dot\f(t) | \\
                    & = | \dot\f(t) | \,,
\end{align}
where in the last equality we used that $\tg$ is unit speed, and so 
$$
\norm{\dot{\tg}} \equiv 1 \,.
$$
To summarize, so far we have proven that
$$
\norm{ \dot \g(t) }  = | \dot\f(t) | \,, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b) \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
s(t) = \int_{t_0}^t \norm{ \dot \g(\tau) } \, d\tau =  \int_{t_0}^t | \dot \f(\tau) | \, d\tau \,.
$$
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we get
$$
\dot s(t) = |\dot \f(t) | 
$$
and therefore 
$$
\f = \pm s + c
$$
for some $c \in \R$, concluding the proof.


*Step 2. Second Point.*  
Suppose that 
$$
\f := \pm s + c
$$
for some $c \in \R$, so that $\phi \ \colon (a,b) \to (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})$. We have 
$$
\dot\f (t) =  \pm \dot s (t) = \pm \norm{ \dot\g(t) } \neq 0  
$${#eq-proposition-unit-speed-2}
where the last term is non-zero since $\g$ is regular. Therefore, due to the Inverse Function Theorem, $\f$ is invertible with smooth inverse. This proves that $\tg$ defined by 
$$
\tg := \g \circ \psi  \,, \quad \psi := \f^{-1} \,,
$$
is a reparametrization of $\g$. In particular 
$$
\g = \tg \circ \f \,.
$$
Differentiating the above, and recalling (@eq-proposition-unit-speed-2), we get
$$
\dot{\g}(t) = \dot{\tg}( \f(t) ) \, \dot\f(t) = \dot{\tg}( \f(t) ) \,\left( \pm \norm{ \dot\g(t) } \right) \,.
$$
Taking the absolute value of the above yields
$$
\norm{ \dot\g(t) } = \norm{ \dot{\tg}( \f(t) )}  \, \norm{ \dot\g(t) } \,.
$$
Since $\g$ is regular we can divide by $\norm{ \dot\g(t) }$ to get
$$
 \norm{ \dot{\tg}( \f(t) )}  = 1 \, \quad \forall \, t \in (a,b)  \, .
$$
Since $\f$ is invertible, the above is equivalent to
$$
 \norm{ \dot{\tg}( t )}  = 1 \, \quad \forall \, t \in (\tilde{a},\tilde{b})  \, ,
$$
proving that $\tg$ is a unit speed reparametrization.
:::


::: Remark
Let $\g$ be regular. The above proposition tells us that they are equivalent:

1. Computing a unit speed reparametrization of $\g$,

2. Computing $s$ the arc-length of $\g$.

In some cases however, unit speed reparametrization and arc-length are impossible to characterize in terms of elementary functions, even for very simple curves.
:::




::: Example 
### Twisted cubic

Define the **twisted cubic** $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^3$ by 
$$
\g(t) = (t,t^2,t^3)\,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
\dot \g(t) = (1,2t,3t^2)\,,
$$
so that 
$$
\dot \g (t) \neq 0 \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R  \,,
$$
meaning that $\g$ is regular. In particular we have
$$
\norm{ \dot \g(t) } = \sqrt{  1 + 4t^2 + 9t^4 }
$$
so that the arc-length of $\g$ is
$$
s(t) = \int_{t_0}^t  \sqrt{  1 + 4\tau^2 + 9\tau^4 }\, d\tau \,.
$$
Since $\g$ is regular, by Proposition \ref{proposition-arc-length-unit} we know that $\g$ admits a unit speed reparametrization $\tg$ such that
$$
\g =  \tg \circ \f
$$
with the diffeomorphism $\f$ given by
$$
\f(t) = \pm s(t) + c = \pm \int_{t_0}^t  \sqrt{  1 + 4\tau^2 + 9\tau^4 }\, d\tau + c
$$
for some $c \in \R$. It can be shown that the above integral does not have a closed form in terms of elementary functions. Therefore the unit speed parametrization $\tg$ cannot be computed explicitly.

## Closed curves


So far we have seen examples of:

- Curves which are infinite, or **unbounded**. This is for example the parabola
$$
\g(t) := (t,t^2) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,,
$$
- Curves which are finite and have end-points, such as the semi-circle
$$
\g(t) := (\cos(t),\sin(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in [0,\pi] \,,
$$
- Curves which form **loops**, such as the circle
$$
\g(t) := (\cos(t),\sin(t)) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in [0,2\pi] \,.
$$

However there are examples of curves which are in between the above types. 

::: {.Example #example-curve-loop}
For example consider the curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^2$
$$
\g(t) := (t^2-1, t^3 -t) \,\quad  \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
This curve has two main properties:

- $\g$ is unbounded: If define $\tg$ as the restriction of $\g$ to the time interval $[1,\infty)$, then $\tg$ is unbounded. A point which starts at $\g (1) = (0,0)$ goes towards infinity. 
- $\g$ contains a loop: If we define $\tg$ as the restriction of $\g$ to the time interval $[-1,1]$, then $\tg$ is a closed loop starting at $\g (-1) = (0,0)$ and returnning at $\g (1) = (0,0)$.

The aim of this section is to make precise the concept of **looping curve**. To do that, we need to define **periodic curves**.


::: Definition
### Periodic curve

Let $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve, and let $T \in \R$. We say that $\g$ is **T-periodic** if 
$$
\g(t) = \g(t+T) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
:::


Note that every curve is $0$-periodic. Therefore to define a closed curve we need to rule out this case.

::: Definition
### Closed curve

Let $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **closed** if:

- $\g$ is not constant,
- $\g$ is T-periodic for some $T \neq 0$.

:::


::: {.Remark  #remark-closed}

We have the following basic facts:

1. If $\g$ is $T$-periodic, then a point moving around $\g$ returns to its starting point after time $T$.

     >This is exactly the definition of $T$-periodicity. Indeed let $p = \g(a)$ be the point in question, then
     $$
     \g(a + T) = \g(a) = p 
     $$ 
     by periodicity. Thus $\g$ returns to $p$ after time $T$.

2. If $\g$ is $T$-periodic, then $\g$ is determined by its restriction to any interval of length $|T|$.

3. Conversely, suppose that $\g \ \colon [a,b] \to \R^n$ satisfies 
$$
\g(a) = \g(b) \,, \quad \frac{d^k \g}{dt^k} (a) =\frac{d^k \g}{dt^k}  (b)  
$$
for all $k \in \N$. Set
$$
T:=b-a \,.
$$
Then $\g$ can be extended to a $T$-periodic curve $\tg \ \colon \R \to \R^n$ defined by
$$
\tg (t) := \g (\tilde{t}) \,, \quad  \tilde{t}:= t - \biggl\lfloor \frac{t-a}{b-a}  \biggr\rfloor (b-a)  \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
The above means that $\tg(t)$ is defined by $\g(\tilde{t})$ where $\tilde{t}$ is the unique point in $[a,b]$ such that 
$$
t = \tilde{t} + k(b-a) 
$$
with $k \in \Z$ defined by
$$
k := \biggl\lfloor \frac{t-a}{b-a}  \biggr\rfloor \,,
$$
see figure below. In this way $\tg$ is $T$-periodic.

4. If $\g$ is $T$-periodic, then it is also $(-T)$-periodic.
     
     >Because if $\g$ is $T$-periodic then 
     $$
     \g (t) = \g ((t - T) + T ) = \g (t - T)
     $$
     where in the first equality we used the trivial identity $t = (t-T) + T$, while in the second equality we used $T$-periodicity of $\g$.

5. If $\g$ is $T$-periodic for some $T \neq 0$, then it is $T$-periodic for some $T>0$.

     > This is an immediate consequence of Point 4.

6. If $\g$ is $T$-periodic the $\g$ is $(kT)$-periodic, for all $k \in \Z$.

     > By point 4 we can assume WLOG that $k \geq 0$. We proceed by induction:   
     > - The statement is true for $k=1$, since $\g$ is $T$-periodic. 
     > - Assume now that $\g$ is $kT$-periodic. Then 
     \begin{align}
     \g(t + (k+1) T) & = \g ( (t+T)  + kT ) & \\
                     & = \g (t + T)   &  \mbox{(by $kT$-periodicity)} \\  
                     & = \g (t)   &  \mbox{(by $T$-periodicity)} 
     \end{align}
     showing that $\g$ is $(k+1)T$-periodic.  

     >By induction we conclude that $\g$ is $(kT)$-periodic for all $k \in \N$.


7. If $\g$ is $T_1$-periodic and $T_2$-periodic then $\g$ is $(k_1T_1 + k_2 T_2)$-periodic, for all $k_1, k_2 \in \Z$.

     > By Point 6 we know that $\g$ is $k_1T_1$-periodic and $k_2T_2$-periodic. Set $T:=k_1T_1 + k_2T_2$. We have
     \begin{align}
     \g(t + T) & = \g ( (t+ k_1T_1)  + k_2T_2 ) & \\
                     & = \g (t + k_1T_1)  &  \mbox{(by $k_2T_2$-periodicity)} \\  
                     & = \g (t)  &  \mbox{(by $k_1T_1$-periodicity)} 
     \end{align}
     showing that $\g$ is $(k_1T_1 + k_2 T_2)$-periodic.

::: Definition

Let $\g$ be a closed curve. The **period** of $\g$ is the smallest $T>0$ such that $\g$ is $T$-periodic, that is
$$
\mbox{Period of $\g$} := \min \{ T \, \colon \, T > 0 \,, \,\, \gamma \, \mbox{ is T-periodic}    \} \,. 
$$
:::


We need to show that the above definition is well-posed, i.e., that there exists such smallest $T>0$.



::: Proposition

Let $\g$ be a closed curve. Then there exists a smallest $T>0$ such that $\g$ is $T$-periodic. In other words, the set 
$$
S := \{ T  \, \colon \, T > 0 \,, \,\, \g \, \mbox{ is T-periodic} \} \,.
$$
admits positive minumum 
$$
P = \min S \,, \quad P > 0 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof


We make 2 observations about the set $S$:

- Since $\g$ is closed, we have that $\g$ is $T$-periodic for some $T \neq 0$. By Remark \ref{remark-closed} Point 5, we know that $T$ can be chosen such that $T>0$. Therefore 
$$
S \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
- $S$ is bounded below by $0$. This is by definition of $S$.

Thus, by the Axiom of Completeness of the Real Numbers, the set $S$ admits an infimum 
$$
P = \inf S \,.
$$
The proof is concluded if we show that:

*Claim*. We have
$$
P = \min S  \,.
$$
This is equivalent to saying that 
$$
P \in S \,.
$$

*Proof of claim.*  
To see that $P \in S$ we need to show that

1. $\g$ is $P$-periodic,
2. $P>0$.

Since $P$ is the infimum of $S$, there exists an infimizing sequence $\{T_n\}_{n \in \N} \subset S$ such that
$$
T_n \to P \,.
$$
WLOG we can choose $T_n$ decreasing, that is, such that
$$
T_1 > T_2 > \ldots > T_n > \ldots > 0 \,.
$$

*Proof of Point 1.* As $T_n \in S$, we have that $\g$ is $T_n$-periodic. Then
$$
\g (t + T_n) = \g(t) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,,  \,\, n \in \N \,.
$$
Since $T_n \to P$, we can take the limit as $n \to \infty$ and use the continuity of $\g$ to obtain
$$
\g(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \ \g (t + T_n) = \g(t + P) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,,
$$
showing that $\g$ is $P$-periodic. 
 

*Proof of Point 2.* Suppose by contradiction that
$$
P = 0 \,.
$$
Fix $t \in \R$. Since $T_n > 0$, we can find unique 
$$
t_n \in [0,T_n] \,, \quad k_n \in \Z \,,
$$
such that 
$$
t = t_n + k_n T_n \,,
$$
as shown in the figure below. Indeed, it is sufficient to define
$$
k_n := \biggl\lfloor \frac{t}{T_n}  \biggr\rfloor \in \Z \,, \quad t_n := t - k_n T_n \,.
$$
Since $T_n \in S$, we know that $\g$ is $T_n$-periodic. Remark \ref{remark-closed} Point 6 implies that $\g$ is also $k_nT_n$-periodic, since $k_n \in \Z$. Thus
\begin{align}
\g (t) & = \g( t_n + k_nT_n )   &   \mbox{(definition of $t_n$)} \\
       & = \g(t_n)             & \mbox{(by $k_nT_n$-periodicity)} \,.
\end{align}
Therefore 
$$
\g(t) = \g(t_n) \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-period-exists-1}
Also notice that 
$$
0 \leq t_n \leq T_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
by construction. Since $T_n \to 0$, by the Squeeze Theorem we conclude that
$$
t_n \to 0  \quad \mbox{as } \, n \to \infty \,.
$$
Using the continuity of $\g$, we can pass to the limit in (@eq-period-exists-1) and obtain
$$
\g(t) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \g(t_n) = \g(0) \,.
$$
Since $t \in \R$ was arbitrary, we have shown that 
$$
\g(t) =  \g(0) \,, \quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
Therefore $\g$ is constant. This is a contradiction, as we were assuming that $\g$ is closed, and, in particular, not constant.

::: Example

Some examples of closed curves: 

- The circumference 
$$
\g (t) = (\cos(t), \sin(t)) \,, \quad t \in \R
$$
is not costant and is $2\pi$-periodic. Thus $\g$ is closed. The period of $\g$ is $2 \pi$.

- The Lemniscate
$$
\g (t) = (\sin(t), \sin(t) \cos(t)) \,, \quad t \in \R
$$
is not costant and is $2\pi$-periodic. Thus $\g$ is closed. The period of $\g$ is $2 \pi$.

- Consider again the curve from Example \ref{example-curve-loop} 
$$
\g(t) := (t^2-1, t^3 -t) \,, \quad \, t \in \R \,.
$$
According to our definition, $\g$ is not periodic. Therefore $\g$ is not closed. However there is a point of **self-intersection** on $\g$, namely 
$$
p := (0,0) \,,
$$ 
for which we have 
$$
p = \g (-1) = \g(1) \,.
$$

The last curve in the above example motivates the definition of **self-intersecting** curve. 


::: Definition
### Self-intersecting curve

Let $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^n$ be a parametrized curve. We say that $\g$ is **self-intersecting** at a point $p$ on the curve if

1. There exist two times $a \neq b$ such that 
$$
p = \g(a)=\g(b)  \,,
$$
2. If $\g$ is closed with period $T$, then $b-a$ is not an integer multiple of $T$.

:::

::: Remark

The second condition in the above definition is important: if we did not require it, then any closed curve would be self-intersecting. Indeed consider a closed curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^n$ and let $T$ be its period. Then by Point 6 in Remark \ref{remark-closed} we have
$$
\g(a) = \g (a + kT) \,, \quad \forall \ a \in \R, \, k \in \Z \,. 
$$ 
Therefore every point $\g(a)$ would be of self-intersection. Point 2 in the above definition rules this example out. Indeed set $b:=a + kT$, then
$$
b - a = k T \,,
$$
meaning that $b-a$ is an integer multiple of $T$.

::: Example

Let us go back to the curve of Example \ref{example-curve-loop}, that is, 
$$
\g(t) := (t^2-1, t^3 -t) \,, \quad \, t \in \R \,.
$$
We have that $\g$ is not periodic, and therefore not closed. However $p = (0,0)$ is a point of **self-intersection** on $\g$, since we have
$$
p = \g (-1) = \g(1) \,.
$$

::: Example
### The Limaçon

Define the parametrized curve $\g \ \colon \R \to \R^2$ by
$$
\g(t) = ( (1+2\cos(t)) \cos(t) ,  (1 + 2 \cos(t)) \sin(t)   ) \,, 
\quad \forall \, t \in \R \,.
$$
Such curve, plotted bolow, is called limaçon (French for snail). This curve is non constant and $2\pi$-periodic. Therefore it is closed. The period of $\g$ is $2 \pi$. Moreover we have
$$
\g( a ) = \g (b) = (0,0)\,.
$$
with $a = 2\pi/3$ and $b = 4\pi/3$. Note that 
$$
b-a = \frac{4\pi}{3} - \frac{2\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} 
$$
which is not an integer multiple of the period $2\pi$. Therefore $\g$ is **self-intersecting** at $(0,0)$.
