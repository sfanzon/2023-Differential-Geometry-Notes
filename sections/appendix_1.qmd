# Plotting curves  {#sec-plot-curves} 

## Curves in 2D  {#sec-plot-2d-curves}

Suppose we want to plot the parabola $y=t^2$ for $t$ in the interval $[-3,3]$. In our language, this is the two-dimensional curve
$$
\g(t) = ( t, t^2 ) \,, \quad  t \in [-3,3] \,.
$$
The two Python libraries we use to plot $\g$ are **numpy** and **matplotlib**. In short, **numpy** handles multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and can perform high-level mathematical functions on them. For any question you may have about numpy, answers can be found in the searchable documentation available [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html). Instead **matplotlib** is a plotting library, with documentation [here](https://matplotlib.org). 
Python libraries need to be imported every time you want to use them. In our case we will import:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

The above imports **numpy** and the module **pyplot** from **matplotlib**, and renames them to `np` and `plt`, respectively. These shorthands are standard in the literature, and they make code much more readable.  
The function for plotting 2D graphs is called `plot(x,y)` and is contained in `plt`. As the syntax suggests, `plot` takes as arguments two arrays 
$$
x=[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\,, \quad  y=[y_1,\ldots,y_n]\,.
$$
As output it produces a graph which is the linear interpolation of the points $(x_i,y_i)$ in $\R^2$, that is, consecutive points $(x_i,y_i)$ and $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})$ are connected by a segment. Using `plot`, we can graph the curve $\g(t)=(t,t^2)$ like so:


```{python} 
#| echo: true

# Code for plotting gamma

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generating array t
t = np.array([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3])

# Computing array f
f = t**2

# Plotting the curve
plt.plot(t,f)

# Plotting dots
plt.plot(t,f,"ko")

# Showing the plot
plt.show()
```

Let us comment the above code. The variable `t` is a numpy array containing the ordered values 
$$ 
t = [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]\,.
$$ {#eq-numpy-array-t}
This array is then squared entry-by-entry via the operation $t\ast\!\ast 2$ and saved in the new numpy array `f`, that is,
$$
f = [9,4,1,0,1,4,9] \,.
$$
The arrays `t` and `f` are then passed to `plot(t,f)`, which produces the above linear interpolation, with `t` on the *x-axis* and `f` on the *y-axis*. The command `plot(t,f,'ko')` instead plots a black dot at each point $(t_i,f_i)$. The latter is clearly not needed to obtain a plot, and it was only included to highlight the fact that `plot` is actually producing a linear interpolation between points. Finally `plt.show()` displays the figure in the user window[^1].  
Of course one can refine the plot so that it resembles the continuous curve $\g(t)=(t,t^2)$ that we all have in mind. This is achieved by generating a numpy array `t` with a finer stepsize, invoking the function `np.linspace(a,b,n)`. Such call will return a numpy array which contains `n` evenly spaced points, starts at `a`, and ends in `b`. For example `np.linspace(-3,3,7)` returns our original array `t` at @eq-numpy-array-t, 
as shown below 

```{python} 
#| echo: true

# Displaying output of np.linspace

import numpy as np

# Generates array t by dividing interval 
# (-3,3) in 7 parts
t = np.linspace(-3,3, 7)

# Prints array t
print("t =", t)
```

In order to have a more refined plot of $\gamma$, we just need to increase $n$.

```{python} 
#| echo: true

# Plotting gamma with finer step-size

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generates array t by dividing interval 
# (-3,3) in 100 parts
t = np.linspace(-3,3, 100)

# Computes f
f = t**2

# Plotting
plt.plot(t,f)
plt.show()
```



[^1]: The command `plt.show()` can be omitted if working in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), as it is called by default.

We now want to plot a parametric curve $\gamma \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ with
$$
\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \,.
$$
Clearly we need to modify the above code. The variable `t` will still be a numpy array produced by `linspace`. We then need to introduce the arrays `x` and `y` which ecode the first and second components of $\gamma$, respectively.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Divides time interval (a,b) in n parts
# and saves output to numpy array t
t = np.linspace(a, b, n)

# Computes gamma from given functions x(y) and y(t)
x = x(t)
y = y(t)

# Plots the curve
plt.plot(x,y)

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```

 



We use the above code to plot the 2D curve known as the [Fermat's spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral)
$$ 
\g(t) = ( \sqrt{t}  \cos(t) , \sqrt{t}  \sin(t) ) \quad 
\text{ for } \quad t \in [0,50] \,.
$$ {#eq-Fermat-Spiral}


```python
# Plotting Fermat's spiral

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Divides time interval (0,50) in 500 parts
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 500)

# Computes Fermat's Spiral
x = np.sqrt(t) * np.cos(t)
y = np.sqrt(t) * np.sin(t)

# Plots the Spiral
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
```

Before displaying the output of the above code, a few comments are in order. The array `t` has size 500, due to the behavior of `linspace`. You can also fact check this information by printing `np.size(t)`, which is the numpy function that returns the size of an array. We then use the numpy function `np.sqrt` to compute the square root of the array `t`. The outcome is still an array with the same size of `t`, that is, 
$$
t=[t_1,\ldots,t_n]   \quad \implies \quad \sqrt{t} = [\sqrt{t_1}, \ldots, \sqrt{t_n}] \,.
$$
Similary, the call `np.cos(t)` returns the array
$$
\cos(t) = [\cos(t_1), \ldots, \cos(t_n)] \,.
$$
The two arrays `np.sqrt(t)` and `np.cos(t)` are then multiplied, term-by-term, and saved in the array `x`. The array `y` is computed similarly. The command `plt.plot(x,y)` then yields the graph of the Fermat's spiral:



```{python} 
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Fermat's spiral" 
# Plotting gamma with finer step-size

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t = np.linspace(0, 50, 500)
x = np.sqrt(t) * np.cos(t)
y = np.sqrt(t) * np.sin(t)

plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()
```

The above plots can be styled a bit. For example we can give a title to the plot, label the axes, plot the spiral by means of green dots, and add a plot legend, as coded below:


```{python} 
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Adding a bit of style" 
#| code-overflow: wrap

# Adding some style

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Computing Spiral
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 500)
x = np.sqrt(t) * np.cos(t)
y = np.sqrt(t) * np.sin(t)

# Generating figure
plt.figure(1, figsize = (4,4))

# Plotting the Spiral with some options
plt.plot(x, y, '--', color = 'deeppink', linewidth = 1.5, label = 'Spiral')

# Adding grid
plt.grid(True, color = 'lightgray')

# Adding title
plt.title("Fermat's spiral for t between 0 and 50")

# Adding axes labels
plt.xlabel("x-axis", fontsize = 15)
plt.ylabel("y-axis", fontsize = 15)

# Showing plot legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

Let us go over the novel part of the above code:

- `plt.figure()`: This command generates a figure object. If you are planning on plotting just one figure at a time, then this command is optional: a figure object is generated implicitly when calling `plt.plot`. Otherwise, if working with `n` figures, you need to generate a figure object with `plt.figure(i)` for each `i` between `1` and `n`. The number `i` uniquely identifies the i-th figure: whenever you call `plt.figure(i)`, Python knows that the next commands will refer to the i-th figure. In our case we only have one figure, so we have used the identifier `1`. The second argument `figsize = (a,b)` in `plt.figure()` specifies the size of `figure 1` in inches. In this case we generated a figure 4 x 4 inches.
- `plt.plot`: This is plotting the arrays `x` and `y`, as usual. However we are adding a few aestethic touches: the curve is plotted in *dashed* style with `--`, in *deep pink* color and with a line width of 1.5. Finally this plot is labelled *Spiral*. 
- `plt.grid`: This enables a grid in *light gray* color.
- `plt.title`: This gives a title to the figure, displayed on top.
- `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel`: These assign labels to the axes, with font size 15 points.
- `plt.legend()`: This plots the legend, with all the labels assigned in the `plt.plot` call. In this case the only label is *Spiral*.


::: {.callout-tip title="Matplotlib styles"}
There are countless plot types and options you can specify in **matplotlib**, see for example the [Matplotlib Gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html). Of course there is no need to  remember every single command: a quick Google search can do wonders.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Generating arrays"}
There are several ways of generating evenly spaced arrays in Python. For example the function `np.arange(a,b,s)` returns an array with values within the half-open interval $[a,b)$, with spacing between values given by `s`. For example
```{python} 
#| echo: true

import numpy as np

t = np.arange(0,1, 0.2)
print("t =",t)
```

## Implicit curves 2D

A curve $\g$ in $\R^2$ can also be defined as the set of points $(x,y) \in \R^2$ satisfying
$$
f(x,y)=0 
$$
for some given $f \colon \R^2 \to \R$. For example let us plot the curve $\g$ implicitly defined by 
$$
f(x,y) =( 3 x^2 - y^2 )^2 \ y^2  -  (x^2 + y^2 )^4 
$$
for $-1 \leq x,y \leq 1$. First, we need a way to generate a grid in $\R^2$ so that we can evaluate $f$ on such grid. To illustrate how to do this, let us generate a grid of spacing 1 in the 2D square $[0,4]^2$. The goal is to obtain the 5 x 5 matrix of coordinates
$$
A = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
(0,0) &  (1,0)  &  (2,0) & (3,0) & (4,0) \\
(0,1) &  (1,1)  &  (2,1) & (3,1) & (4,1) \\
(0,2) &  (1,2)  &  (2,2) & (2,3) & (2,4) \\
(0,3) &  (1,3)  &  (2,3) & (3,3) & (3,4) \\
(0,4) &  (1,4)  &  (2,4) & (3,4) & (4,4) \\
\end{matrix}
\right)    
$$
which corresponds to the grid of points
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "The 5 x 5 grid corresponding to the matrix A"
#| label: fig-grid-example
 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x_list = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)
y_list = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_list, y_list)

plt.figure(figsize = (4,4))
plt.plot(X,Y, 'k.')
```


To achieve this, first generate `x` and `y` coordinates using 

```python
x = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)
y = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)
```
This generates coordinates
$$
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \,, \quad  y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \,.
$$
We then need to obtain two matrices $X$ and $Y$: one for the $x$ coordinates in $A$, and one for the $y$ coordinates in $A$. This can be achieved with the code 

```python
X[0,0] = 0 
X[0,1] = 1
X[0,2] = 2
X[0,3] = 3
X[0,4] = 4
X[1,0] = 0
X[1,1] = 1
...
x[4,3] = 3
x[4,4] = 4
```

and similarly for $Y$. The output would be the two matrices $X$ and $Y$
$$
X = \left( 
\begin{matrix}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\end{matrix}
\right)   \,, \quad 
Y = 
\left( 
\begin{matrix}
0 &  0 &  0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 &  1 &  1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 &  2 &  2 & 2 & 2 \\
3 &  3 &  3 & 3 & 3 \\
4 &  4 &  4 & 4 & 4 \\
\end{matrix}
\right)   
$$

If now we plot $X$ against $Y$ via the command

```python
plt.plot(X, Y, 'k.')
```
we obtain @fig-grid-example. In the above command the style `'k.'` represents black dots. 
This procedure would be impossible with large vectors. Thankfully there is a function in numpy doing exactly what we need: `np.meshgrid`. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
 
# Demonstrating np.meshgrid

import numpy as np

# Generating x and y coordinates
xlist = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)
ylist = np.linspace(0, 4, 5)

# Generating grid X, Y
X, Y = np.meshgrid(xlist, ylist)

# Printing the matrices X and Y
# np.array2string is only needed to align outputs
print('X =', np.array2string(X, prefix='X= '))
print('\n')  
print('Y =', np.array2string(Y, prefix='Y= '))
```

Now that we have our grid, we can evaluate the function $f$ on it. This is simply done with the command
```python
Z =((3*(X**2) - Y**2)**2)*(Y**2) - (X**2 + Y**2)**4 
```
This will return the matrix $Z$ containing the values $f(x_i,y_i)$ for all $(x_i,y_i)$ in the grid $[X,Y]$. We are now interested in plotting the points in the grid $[X,Y]$ for which $Z$ is zero. This is achieved with the command

```python
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, [0])
```

Putting the above observations together, we have the code for plotting the curve $f=0$ for $-1 \leq x,y \leq 1$. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Plot of the curve defined by f=0" 

# Plotting f=0

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generates coordinates and grid
xlist = np.linspace(-1, 1, 5000)
ylist = np.linspace(-1, 1, 5000)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(xlist, ylist)

# Computes f
Z =((3*(X**2) - Y**2)**2)*(Y**2) - (X**2 + Y**2)**4 

# Creates figure object
plt.figure(figsize = (4,4))

# Plots level set Z = 0
plt.contour(X, Y, Z, [0])

# Set axes labels
plt.xlabel("x-axis", fontsize = 15)
plt.ylabel("y-axis", fontsize = 15)

# Shows plot
plt.show()
```





## Curves in 3D


Plotting in 3D with matplotlib requires the `mplot3d` toolkit, see [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/tutorials/toolkits/mplot3d.html) for documentation. Therefore our first lines will always be

```python
# Packages for 3D plots

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d
```

We can now generate empty 3D axes

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Generates and plots empty 3D axes

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Creates figure object
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (4,4))

# Creates 3D axes object
ax = plt.axes(projection = '3d')

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```


In the above code `fig` is a figure object, while `ax` is an axes object. In practice, the figure object contains the axes objects, and the actual plot information will be contained in axes. If you want multiple plots in the figure container, you should use the command 

```python
ax = fig.add_subplot(nrows = m, ncols = n, pos = k)
```

This generates an axes object `ax` in position `k` with respect to a `m x n` grid of plots in the container figure. For example we can create a 3 x 2 grid of empty 3D axes as follows

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Generates 3 x 2 empty 3D axes

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Creates container figure object
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (6,8))

# Creates 6 empty 3D axes objects
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 1, projection = '3d')
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 2, projection = '3d')
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 3, projection = '3d')
ax4 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 4, projection = '3d')
ax5 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 5, projection = '3d')
ax6 = fig.add_subplot(3, 2, 6, projection = '3d')

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```

We are now ready to plot a 3D parametric curve $\gamma \colon (a,b) \to \R^3$ of the form
$$
\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t))
$$
with the code
```python
# Code to plot 3D curve

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Generates figure and 3D axes
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (size1,size2))
ax = plt.axes(projection = '3d')

# Plots grid
ax.grid(True)

# Divides time interval (a,b)
# into n parts and saves them in array t
t = np.linspace(a, b, n)

# Computes the curve gamma on array t
# for given functions x(t), y(t), z(t)
x = x(t) 
y = y(t)
z = z(t)

# Plots gamma
ax.plot3D(x, y, z)

# Setting title for plot
ax.set_title('3D Plot of gamma')

# Setting axes labels
ax.set_xlabel('x', labelpad = 'p')
ax.set_ylabel('y', labelpad = 'p')
ax.set_zlabel('z', labelpad = 'p')

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```

For example we can use the above code to plot the Helix
$$
x(t) = \cos(t) \,, \quad 
y(t) = \sin(t) \,, \quad
z(t) = t
$$
for $t \in [0,6\pi]$.



```{python}
# Plotting 3D Helix

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Generates figure and 3D axes
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (4,4))
ax = plt.axes(projection = '3d')

# Plots grid
ax.grid(True)

# Divides time interval (0,6pi) in 100 parts 
t = np.linspace(0, 6*np.pi, 100)

# Computes Helix
x = np.cos(t) 
y = np.sin(t)
z = t

# Plots Helix - We added some styling
ax.plot3D(x, y, z, color = "deeppink", linewidth = 2)

# Setting title for plot
ax.set_title('3D Plot of Helix')

# Setting axes labels
ax.set_xlabel('x', labelpad = 20)
ax.set_ylabel('y', labelpad = 20)
ax.set_zlabel('z', labelpad = 20)

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```

We can also change the viewing angle for a 3D plot store in `ax`. This is done via

```python
ax.view_init(elev = e, azim = a)
```

which displays the 3D axes with an elevation angle `elev` of `e` degrees and an azimuthal angle `azim` of `a` degrees. In other words, the 3D plot will be rotated by `e` degrees above the xy-plane and by `a` degrees around the z-axis. For example, let us plot the helix with 2 viewing angles. Note that we generate 2 sets of axes with the `add_subplot` command discussed above. 

```{python}
# Plotting 3D Helix

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits import mplot3d

# Generates figure object
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (4,4))

# Generates 2 sets of 3D axes
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1, projection = '3d')
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2, projection = '3d')

# We will not show a grid this time
ax1.grid(False)
ax2.grid(False)

# Divides time interval (0,6pi) in 100 parts 
t = np.linspace(0, 6*np.pi, 100)

# Computes Helix
x = np.cos(t) 
y = np.sin(t)
z = t

# Plots Helix on both axes
ax1.plot3D(x, y, z, color = "deeppink", linewidth = 1.5)
ax2.plot3D(x, y, z, color = "deeppink", linewidth = 1.5)

# Setting title for plots
ax1.set_title('Helix from above')
ax2.set_title('Helix from side')

# Changing viewing angle of ax1
# View from above has elev = 90 and azim = 0
ax1.view_init(elev = 90, azim = 0)

# Changing viewing angle of ax2
# View from side has elev = 0 and azim = 0
ax2.view_init(elev = 0, azim = 0)

# Shows the plot
plt.show()
```



## Interactive plots  {#sec-plot-2d-interactive}

`Matplotlib` produces beautiful static plots; however it lacks built in interactivity. For this reason I would also like to show you how to plot curves with `Plotly`, a very popular Python graphic library which has built in interactivity. Documentation for `Plotly` and lots of examples can be found [here](https://plotly.com/python/).


### 2D Plots   {#sec-plot-2d-curves-interactive}

Say we want to plot the curve $\gamma \colon (a,b) \to \R^2$ parametrized by
$$
\gamma(t) = ( x(t) , y(t) ) \,.
$$
The `Plotly` module needed is called `graph_objects`, usually imported as `go`. The function for line plots is called `Scatter`. For documentation and examples see [link](https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/). The code for plotting $\gamma$ is as follows.

```python
# Plotting gamma

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Compute times grid by dividing (a,b) in 
# n equal parts
t = np.linspace(a, b, n)

# Compute the parametric curve gamma
# for given functions x(t) and y(t)
x = x(t)
y = y(t)

# Create empty figure object and saves 
# it in the variable "fig"
fig = go.Figure()

# Create the line plot object
data = go.Scatter(x = x, y = y, mode = 'lines', name = 'gamma')

# Add "data" plot to the figure "fig"
fig.add_trace(data)

# Display the figure
fig.show()
```

Some comments about the functions called above:

- `go.Figure`: generates an empty Plotly figure
- `go.Scatter`: generates the actual plot. By default a scatter plot is produced. To obtain linear interpolation of the points, set `mode = 'lines'`. You can also label the plot with `name = "string"`
- `add_trace`: adds a plot to a figure
- `show`: displays a figure

As an example, let us plot the Fermat's Spiral defined at @eq-Fermat-Spiral. Compared to the above code, we also add a bit of styling.

```{python}
# Plotting Fermat's Spiral

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Compute times grid by dividing (0,50) in 
# 500 equal parts
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 500)

# Computes Fermat's Spiral
x = np.sqrt(t) * np.cos(t)
y = np.sqrt(t) * np.sin(t)

# Create empty figure object and saves 
# it in the variable "fig"
fig = go.Figure()

# Create the line plot object
data = go.Scatter(x = x, y = y, mode = 'lines', name = 'gamma')

# Add "data" plot to the figure "fig"
fig.add_trace(data)

# Here we start with the styling options
# First we set a figure title
fig.update_layout(title_text = "Plotting Fermat's Spiral with Plotly")

# Adjust figure size
fig.update_layout(autosize = False, width = 600, height = 600)

# 
fig.update_layout(paper_bgcolor = "lightgrey")

# Display the figure
fig.show()
```
