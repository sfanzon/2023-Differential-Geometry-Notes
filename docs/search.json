Another good reading is the book by Abbott [2]. I also point out the classic book by Rudin [3], although this is more difficult to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou are not expected to purchase any of the above books. These lecture notes will cover 100% of the topics you are expected to known in order to excel in the final exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] R.G. Bartle, D.R.
